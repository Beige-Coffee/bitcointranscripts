 Good morning Danny. Morning Peter. Morning Danny. Morning Peter. Morning Danny. Morning Danny. Morning Danny. A couple of daddies on the show. Danny, nice to find a get-you-on-show man. He's an excited to be here. It's been a long time and nice to finally get over. Which is good. Thank you for having me. Anytime man, would have been nice to have Molly here too. Yeah, I think a couple of the team were jumping in. One, it's jumping, joining as well. Fortunately, too busy in the office at the moment. I'll get Molly on some time. So, listen man, firstly, big credit. Everything you've been doing for the UK market. I've been neglecting it, running over to the States and talking all the Americans, everyone over there. But I know you've been working very hard on the UK market. It's great to see an Edinburgh and hang out. See everything you're doing. Me and Danny here. Danny Knowles have been talking about the fact that we should be doing a bit more in the UK market. And so we're going to be dedicated a bit more time here ourselves. But just for people listening, if people don't know you, Danny, they don't know Korna, Danny, just do an intro to yourself. Tell everyone who you are, what you do, where you're from. OK, thank you. So, yeah, I'm Danny Scott from Korna, which is a UK Bitcoin company. Sorry, British Bitcoin company should we say. So we're based in the Alabama. I caught the webinar round since 2014. I'm founder, CEO of Korna. I still have a quite small team over there. But we've been heavily focused on Bitcoin and what Bitcoin can do from a utility in a use case perspective. Last night we were hanging out with a bit. And you were telling us, you're not just a really in exchange of building a Bitcoin ecosystem. So can you just talk about the ecosystem of products you're building and what the kind of strategies behind this? Yeah. So I think initially when we first started out, we'd come in Korna in 2014, people wanted to buy Bitcoin. So we wanted to create an easy on ramp, get people onto buy Bitcoin. That was the use case back then, buying it, or getting exposure to it with its investment, store value, whatever you want to classify us. Once I got myself and some of the founders got heads into Bitcoin and how it works properly, it was kind of like, OK, this is a real world use case. It can be used in certain ways that we all go through that cyclic I think of understanding the cycle of it's going to solve everything that solves nothing. It solves that. You back and forward to all the time with various concepts and ideas. But once we've kind of created this on board, a theater on ramp for Bitcoin is going to buy Bitcoin. We wanted to say, OK, well, how do we what's this long term project? What's are we just trying to get people to spec out the price? Is Bitcoin actually going to be using the real world? And a lot of the other competitors at the time going into like 2016, 17 times, they were just creating altcoin casinos, people I haven't. That changed layer. So they were creating casinos effectively, and it was all one speculating on the price of things. And there was no what we saw as a value there in terms of a real world value real world use case. There was just nothing there. So we wanted to try and come away from that and push ourselves away and be more of a niche and go, OK, well, how can Bitcoin actually be used in the world? So we started introducing all sorts of things really throughout. So you can also buy Bitcoin. You've got to wallet on the app. You can send and receive now with lightning. We've introduced merchant services, so merchants all around the world can happen to count with those. They can pay invoices, receive payments. That can be, for example, an airline company can invoice somebody in South Africa and South African pay them, buy Bitcoin, come straight into their coin corner account, and it can be flipped to pounds of euros. So it was then a focus of, OK, well, there's real world use cases here. There's cross-border payments. We're seeing it kind of seeing it in our Salvador in certain areas, obviously, a bit of a top-down approach. But there is real world use cases for this. And it was kind of like, if it's going to be a payment system that everyone thinks it is, like with lightning, can we also sort of relate that to the real world and what people are familiar with in the real world? And especially in the UK, 93% of in-person payments now in the UK are contactless payments. So that was where we thought, OK, well, how do we create products and like people using the traditional financial, legacy financial world? How do we bring that into our world? So we then create the bulkguard, which was then contactless lightning guard to tap and pay. So that ecosystem is slowly evolved out. We've got recurring payments. We've got all sorts of things now that we're going to build around, without saying, copying or cloning the traditional financial system were all online. So eventually, we see the long game as what we have with Bitcoin, Lightning is far superior as technology to what the current financial system has and is. And over time, that will migrate over to Bitcoin, Lightning. So that's going to take years and decades away. But that's where we're positioning ourselves to make sure we're driving that for one and showing that it can be done, which it can be done, and then trying to actually position ourselves from the future to be that company there that supports this ecosystem. So where some exchanges really just give you the ability to buy and hold or maybe custody, you're thinking of the net step. You're almost kind of like a bank in some ways and you're helping facilitate payments and convert back to fiat. So is that the kind of strategy to be more bank-like? We're not a bank. I know you're not a bank, but you're providing that. So you're providing it almost banking-like services. It's kind of like Bitcoin banking is kind of where you go down. So yeah, it's cloning the legacy system and trying to bring that onto the Bitcoin standard and running on that level of technology. But the way I see it in the way we look at legacy technology and legacy systems, visa and Mastercard, Swift, everything else, the innovation on them is granted to a halt. It doesn't really change, nothing really happens. It doesn't move. It's very centralized, it's very controlled. What we have with Bitcoin Lightning Networks open interoperable, that allows for innovations happen overnight. We released bulk card in the May, June this year and already because it's open and people can go and play with it and use it in different ways. You can already do it in a non-custodial way. People are creating their own versions of the cards. People are using it in Brazil, in Salvador, the other sudden within four or five months, it's been used, I think, in about 45 different countries where we've had videos of people using it and showing it. And it's not all coin corners and coin corners customers. It's the card itself just being used. And so it shows how fast innovation can happen. A lot of this stuff will make sense for Bitcoin, that's right. Like if I was coming to a job and I was like, Danny, I want to integrate some of this stuff into the FUBG Club. We want to be able to pay for shirts online and accept it and convert it back to VR to move and take money to the ground. That kind of all makes sense to me because I'm a Bitcoiner. In terms of how are you kind of orange-pilling companies? Because you've created some adoption, obviously, with retailers accepting Bitcoin. And you've probably spoken various companies who are doing remittance. But what is the process of orange-pilling them into using Bitcoin? What are the hurdles for them? And what problems have you been solving? So the main thing, and this is a little bit of a reality thing for a lot of the industry and what we have to do, stop forcing Bitcoin down people's throats. It doesn't work. OK, my work 10% at the time. But a lot of it is wasted resource and energy as such. What you need to do and what the guest experience we've had over the years is make sure we can find problems that we can solve for people using Bitcoin. So what you've touched on there with the cross-border payment side, that there's companies all around the world in different jurisdictions. That makes struggle. We bank in, make struggle with access to swift networks. We've been through these rules ourselves. They might bank accounts. We've lost account of as a company. And we've ended up banking in Eastern Europe and Hong Kong and everywhere over the years. Because we couldn't access traditional banking. We're a legitimate company and running as far as we can. But there's nothing we can do. UK banks wouldn't touch us. We really experienced what I've heard with banks. Yeah. All based on Bitcoin. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it's the same. I mean, I've personally lost bank accounts because of it. I've companies lost bank accounts because of it. It's been hard. And that was a bit of an eye opener to, and it will be for yourself as well, how, yeah, there are so many people and companies around the world that have them same struggles every day, just because of jurisdictional industry or anything to do with them potentially. Yeah, I can't figure out if this is down to these companies being scared of Bitcoin or it's because of the restrictions and requirements put them by the government for money and order in a KYC. And it's just too much risk for them. Like the conspiracy side says, oh, the banks, it's like Turkey's vote for Christmas. They're not going to do that. But I actually think it's more to do. I think it's probably more to do with the requirements put them by government. Yeah, I think quite heavily, yes. And they uneducated. So back in, say, 2015, 16 times, I put it down to like it would do just uneducated. Didn't know why it was. They were scared of it. They were just like, we don't know. We haven't got the expertise and the resource to deal with this. So we're just going to leave it alone. As time's gone on, they've always been interested in the banks, especially, like say UK mainstream banks. We've spoken to them many times over the years in all different capacities. As that's kind of gone forwards, that's kind of changed whether they know it's coming and they know they've got to do something and get involved. They're just now trying to figure out, how do we get involved? And what do we do? And I guess now is the time where we're seeing, is it an anticompetitive thing? Or are they still just unsure of it? I'm not quite sure. Years ago, 2016, I would have said, yeah, they were just uneducated and scared of it because of the regulations they had around them. Now, I think it's starting to become more of an anticompetitive move where they say anticompetitive, anticompetitive, and I know for well resource as well. We have something called APB fraud. And if you guys are familiar with that, we know there was an automatic push payment. So somebody is like a real man scam style thing. So somebody is getting scammed by somebody else around the world and they tell you, I need some money, come and buy a Bitcoin from wherever Coinbase, coincoin, and they buy some funds in the standard. We have, I guess, built internally a process to catch these in handling. And we have done this over the years. And it's took as many years, I guess, to get to a point where we're comfortable with that. But a lot of the banks, if anything like flags up from that perspective, we've actually spoken to how to educate the banks on how to handle these sort of things. And they just handle at the time, the resource. So they're just saying now they're just not going to let them send GBP to coincoin to buy Bitcoin because they don't have the resource. It's easier for them to just say no. And that is, you know, whether that's internal banking policies in terms of who, where the funds are going to which department, I think is generally the thing that people are shouting at. So there's so many nuances, I guess, to the thing, to the point, I guess, of why are banks not banking some of these industries like ourselves? And there's loads of the sectors out there that are, and your CBD gaming, you add all everything, you know, their high risk industries, that banks struggle to bank. When you've had banks remove your business from them or to coin your business, usually for me, both times it's been while I've been with a company for quite some time. So lawyers, I've been with them for 25 years, I've been through the story of why they kicked me out. And then I moved to wise for both personal and business. It was actually quite light wise for a while. It was a great service. The reason they closed my account is they said, do you cannot make transfers to exchanges, which I didn't. But what would happen is whenever I had a significant invoice being paid by a sponsor, I would have to go through this lengthy KYC process, which was who's the money coming from and why, and I'd be explained, and then they say, okay, can you show me a contract and an invoice? I'd have to show them contracts and invoices. They actually closed my account because of Gemini. Right. Okay. Because they, even though it wasn't in their terms of service, their terms of service says you cannot send money to exchanges. They actually said, well, see, and she'll do in business with a cryptocurrency exchange. We weren't allowed, even though Gemini probably the most regulated exchange, we have a full contract. And it's for buying advertising services. They still closed my account based on that. Each time it happens, it's actually quite a headache because they don't give you a long, no, Louise gave me six weeks. Why is froze my account immediately? Well, immediately froze access to the account. So I couldn't do transfers. I had to put in a request to have the money with drawn, which would take 10 days. And I didn't actually. I think did I end up paying your wages for my personal account? I can't remember. Yeah. So I was like, where do I go and get a count? I've literally got one with Revolute. But for 10 days, I had my business frozen with no warning. Yeah. It's insane. It's insane. Yeah. I think, yeah, we've not had the frozen piece and that's an area of just yet obviously. We've lost accounts over the years. Mine was a personal one at HSBC. Right. And I'd had that again for, since I was 12 or over 13 at the time when you first get your first bank account. And I think it was in 2016. They closed my account with 30 days notice. And I was trying to contact someone who hadn't taught to me. I eventually went into one of the branches. Court, one of the guys there that was trying to help me through it. It was just as lost as I was at the time. It'd come from London and HQ. He said, so he couldn't tell me the reason why they were closed in it. Eventually got out of them. He said, I said, it's because of Bitcoin. And the guy came a lot to me like didn't know what to say. Panicked. And then as I was leaving, he said, if your circumstances change, we'll welcome you back. I was kind of like, really? Yeah. So the fact is that just because I was an older of a Bitcoin exchange, they just didn't want to touch me. I love the fucking crit one more. No, no. Dude, listen, I had it with Lloyd's. The one with there was they just called me up and they wanted to ask me about transfers. And I said, it's not that you're fucking business. I mean, not in those words. And then I got a letter, two weeks later, saying, we're closing your account in six weeks. And I called him and said, what's the reason I said, we don't give out the reason. I was like, I've been with you for 25 years. I've had every mortgage payment go out. I've never even, I don't think I've been in an overdraft for 20 years. I said, you have never had anything to complain about that alone, which was paid off in full. I'm the perfect customer. Actually, I'm the shit customer because I don't use overdraft fees. But I've never done anything wrong. And you're closing my account. And you're not telling me. I think it's fucking terrible. It is. Yeah. I blame the government for this, though. It is. Yeah. That sometimes the banks are not to blame, I think. And it is, and lots of governments are to blame. I am. Whoever the government, yeah. I guess it's to see how source surveillance to the banks. Yeah. I guess I'm also in the individuals with the government at that time, especially not it's the laws we now have in place and the regulations we have to work through. And we're seeing that in our industry already now. We're seeing regulation become tighter and squeeze in different ways. And they're trying to do still force legacy concepts, I think, into a lot of the Bitcoin industry, which is just it doesn't work. So there's quite an uphill battle that we're going to think about. Well, it's holding the UK back. It has been for a while here. Unfortunately, I think with, I mean, we're Al-Mann. We were, we fell in the, what we call, designated business in the Al-Mann under the FSA, which is kind of the equivalent of the crypto register in the UK. But we've been under that since 2016. So we've been one of the longest running exchanges. That's fell under any form of obligation to do like AML, KYC. So that was done by the Al-Mann in 2016. And it's only just getting done by the UK now, which is like, you know, was six years later. And it's still, I guess the first batch of them went through maybe a year ago. So it was five years to get to that stage. So it's, and then I appreciate the UK is in much bigger country than the Al-Mann. It's an Al-Mann's a tiny little place that can be nimble and react quickly. But yeah, governments, especially with Brexit, with the UK at the minute and the way that's been in the financial industry in London, slowly jumping ship and going to Paris and elsewhere, you know, that's got to be a wake up call to them and they need to react. But I think they're, you know, the likes of the FTX, so they're in everything's just none of that's going to help. And it's just going to make things ten times worse, if you want to. And you can explain the amount of people listening because obviously, we've got to listen around all around the world. And they probably don't even know what that one is. So the Al-Mann is, I was getting this wrong. So it's in Great Britain. But it's not within the UK. So it sits in between the UK and Ireland. So it's a tiny little island just between the two of them. It's a South sovereign state. So it's has its own government regulation. It's the longest running government in the world, I think. Or Tim old. It's like, oh, Hawaii, isn't it? Yeah. The weather's just like, oh, I hear. LAUGHTER What is it? 80,000 people live there? Yeah, I think that 80,000, 85,000 things. So on such a small island, with a small population, does that mean you get the ability to have a kind of direct dialogue with lawmakers? Yeah. Yeah. Massively helpful. So back in 2015 or 14, 15, 16, when we first were getting up and running, they were working with them to help create something that would work for the industry and let us grow and let them have an oversight of what's going on and make them comfortable effectively. So yeah, it was, you know, I can drop them an email, call them open, I can go in and meet in the next day in person and have a conversation with them. So I appreciate it again. It's a small country. So you get that flexibility in that opportunity whereas in the UK, it's much bigger and many more clients and businesses to deal with. So it's harder to do that. But yeah, the communication has been incredibly good. I think that. And I mean, even with the Dubai side of things where we're open in office in Dubai at the moment in the UAE. Oh, are you? And the user told us that. He told me that. Yeah. It was out on the phone. You might have been. Yeah. All right. So you need to update me on that. That was back in when I was up back in September. OK. So we did a partnership. We got a partnership with a rural family office over there. Oh, yeah. With the shakes. It's with one of the shakes. Yeah. Which has been a bit surreal, a bit weird. How the fuck did that come about? That was, honestly, I've told this story so many times now. But it is. I, we got an email from maybe who was thinking about March time from some lady and I kind of ignored it and thought, OK, don't know what this is. That was OK. I thought it was like Nigeria and Prince. Scam, like they wanted to partner with us and do things. So I was kind of like, ignored it, ignored it. I think ignored it for about a month. And then eventually she'd kept chasing. So I messaged on LinkedIn just to chat. Google the checks or out checks the family office out. Messaged on LinkedIn. So that is just really you. My email and me and she was like, yeah, please, can you reply? I was like, OK, sorry. I'll reply too quickly. So that was Ben in, I think, April, Maytime. Probably conversations picked up and what they do over there. So they're the Royal Family Office for one of the Alma 2 Royal Family members, one of the shakes there. They find companies all around the world that are in innovative technology and industries and they try and help bring them to the buy in the UAE. So they help partner with you. They help introduce you to their network of companies, which is incredibly vast. They help you with regulations and banking and everything like that. So they help us effectively set up office there, set up shop there. So what is it? Is it investment? Is it a partnership on a secondary business? JV partnership. OK. And so what you're setting up in another. But you're basically replicating yourselves as there. I'm going to be company will be open any time now. We've got the regulation to sort of most come to that with the regulation over there. The regulator is called Vara. We're just going through that process with them at the minute. That probably will be sort of Q1, Q2, actually about time we can get the license and start operating there. Have you been out? Yeah. You know, to meet them and what was that? It was amazing to be fair. It was really like the first time I'd ever been and to buy in itself is just incredible. You guys been. I've only transferred there when I went to Mauritius. So I've flown in and like even flying in, you're like, what? Yeah. It's insane. Everything is luxurious. Everything is big. It's so clean. Like even just walking down the main streets. It's just everything so clean. So nice. Everyone's polite. From my experience there anyway, maybe other people are different experiences. But yeah, it was true. You like the parties. They take you up to dinner. The treat doesn't work well. But yeah, we did not know quite like that. But yeah, it was very organized, very professional. So what do you think this means for the business then? So I guess from our perspective, again, this is like this use case and how do you find the use case? And in the UK, this is a big thing in the UK. Bitcoin is a payment method and things are. It doesn't have a massive use case right now. And that is a reality. That's not people need to wake up sometimes. You can, we've got merchants in the UK and you can go and pay with Bitcoin. And it's great. And it actually gets people a lot of market and it will bring customers that you wouldn't normally get. So there's positives. However, everybody has a Visa card, Mastercard, people generally, they'll struggle with banking and access to the system. So there's no real use case for it. So looking outside of the UK, that's where we've been in trying to look to different jurisdictions and different ways we can help. Bitcoin is a utility. So Dubai, the UAE has an incredibly vast amount of immigrants. So they've got, I think it's about 25% of Dubai is Emiratis, which is local people there. Then you've got the 75% is made up of all sorts of cultures and people from around the world. So we've what that opens up to is remittance markets. So there's an example that I think we have. It's like 250,000 Filipinos, I think, in Dubai alone, that will remit every month back to Philippines. So obviously you've got markets there that are, if we can open up in Dubai and the UAE, we can then hopefully help people with remittance products and to remove remit Bitcoin or value, whatever that may be, Durham, in Dubai, back to the Philippines, the PHP there. So what would they use you as, as I say, Western Union? What's the, like, do you have to have, therefore, a shop in the Philippines? No. So what we've, so what you guys, I think you saw, Danny, didn't you, strikes announcement this week with BitNub, very simple, which is, that's effectively allowing, so the way that's kind of done in the minute, people seem to be a little bit confused with that as well on socials, but you can go into your strike app, you can put some bank details in for Kenya, Ghana or Nigeria, and who is going to, and then you can click send that in the background, he's getting a lightning invoice from BitNub, and then strike our paying, that lightning invoice or flipping the dollar to Bitcoin, paying the lightning invoice at the BitNub's end in Africa. They're flipping that Bitcoin back to their local currency and sending that on to potentially the bank accounts to the MPESSA accounts, the money mobile accounts, and more sorts of things. So it's instant and ridiculously cheap. When you start looking at the remittance fees around the world, I think it's Nigeria's averages like around 9% fees on remittance. We're also doing the same thing with BitNub, sat here this morning waiting for the announcement to go which hasn't yet, but that will, I think when we've been testing, we're looking at maybe like one and a half to 2% fee, and that's including FX rates and fees on all combined. So you can recover rates by like 7% there. You can almost hit spot rate, which- Wow. And 24-7 FX worlds obviously operates in Monte de Friety, so it's 24-7, you can do it weekends, any time in any time of day, it's instant, it's cost next to nothing. See, we, Danny, we keep hearing about the Bitcoin remittance story. We heard about it with El Salvador. We've heard about it with Strike. Like, we keep hearing about it. Yeah, we haven't seen like an explosion of it. Is this really just about education then? Yeah, it's been a combination of education and infrastructure. So we, years ago, we were talking to a venture capital company back in 2015 and 16 and they wanted to do a remittance product from UK and Europe back to Philippines, I think it was. And at the time, we've said, OK, yes, you can send Bitcoin from, you can buy it with us, you can send it over to the Philippines. But we don't have access to the banking to the system there. We had to get that back into the hands. There wasn't really a Filipino exchange. You couldn't really do anything. That infrastructure wasn't possible. Now, and that was also with on-chain Bitcoin rather than lining. Now we've got lining. Now we've got the infrastructure there, pouch, for example, or in Philippines, and we can do that with pouch. What's pouch? Pouch is a Bitcoin lining wallet first. So you have the one doing the Bitcoin island, I don't know. Yeah, the place you want to go. Yeah, OK. I stole our name, Bitcoin island. But yes, so pouch are doing it. Philippines, and we can then send lining payments to them. And they can auto flip to their local currency and straight into their local bank accounts. And vice versa, but the UK or Europe with ourselves. Bit no, but the same in Africa. There's new Trump pay in Vietnam. There's Bipper in Brazil. There's loads of these now being built out. So these now are like lining companies that are effectively just building out a lining wallet that you can receive money into, and it will auto flip to fear, and go the other way, save me strike in the US. So you need to partner with these all over the world. Yeah. So what we're already doing in the background there, so we're already working with pretty much all of them. The guys that have just mentioned and trying to help bring together more of a more of a greed structure, should we call it, of how the remit should work for lining payments. So it becomes as easy as like you open your coin corner app, you type in, for example, do you guys not lining in the rest addresses, though? Do I know what I like? This is addresses. I like in the address. Yes. Of course, I'm not that bad. Just checking. I don't like in the address, don't you? Yeah, I do. I know what an X-pub is. OK. Could you explain? Well, an X-pub. Did you see the tweet I put out about there? Yeah. Do you know that was a chat AI one? I was it. Oh, yeah. That was a point. You know what I was doing chat AI? Yeah. So I went on to the chat AI. I said, write me an intelligent tweet of 280 characters explaining what Bitcoin X-pub is. And that's what I put out. And I'd like a few people's by it. I didn't know. They were like, I mean, I knew you'd copy me basically. I got an email from a guy. So I've just seen you or a tweet about X-pub. He's like, you've come along way, man. You really, really heard that. I was like, dude, that's a chat AI. I could come up with that shit. Yeah, I know what an app I did address. So yeah, you can think about it. It's obviously for people listening. If you're not aware, it's lightning address. It kind of looks like an email address. And you can then, if that's the other type, in like, Danny at pouch.ph. And that could be your lightning address for your pouch account in the Philippines. We can then, from going on, you can just type it into your app, send 100 pounds, press the button. It'll pull 100 pounds from your coin corner balance. Turn into Bitcoin, send a Bitcoin over to your var lightning, and you'll receive it and flip it to the side. Does every night an payment need to start with an invoice? Yes. Well, there's key sense. And you can candidate with the key send, rather, but it's not really widely used. But can you have auto invoice creation? So someone doesn't like, if I'm on, if Danny had an address, I just want to send him lightning tips, right? Yeah. How does that invoice get created for that tip to get sent? So in the back, so for a lightning address, well, you need to lighten and dress. OK. Type it in, press the button, and it'll, you don't need to create an invoice. In the background, it's creating the invoice for you. OK. So it's communicating with that other service. Think is what, say, give me an invoice, because I'm going to pay it. Yeah. Right. OK. Yeah. And you wouldn't be aware it's even creating the invoice and doing that on the background. It's kind of like sending an email, you know, aware of what's going on in the background for that 17p. Why does lightning require invoices to be better? What's the idea behind that? Um, you're asking two technical questions here. Why does it require? I tell you, it's just, yes, I'll just try. I'll try. Yeah. I'll see what try it makes. I'm interested in it. This is all. Um, has it got it, no? It's still working. In order to make a payment over the lightning network, the sender must provide the recipient with an invoice, which is cryptocurrency proof of the payment terms agreed upon for the channel. This invoice contains information such as the amount of payment, the payments recipient and the CTO associated with the payment channel. I can't let that happen. That is a pretty software. The invoice also includes a payment pre-image, which is secret value that the sender must use to prove that they actually have the ability to make the payment. Don't you love this thing, process? Do you do another one in the background? Tell the story of the Bitcoin cup football final between rail Bedford and Oxford City. You can't ask a user better teams. Is there someone looking to do that shit? But it might come up the stuff. Not able to browse the web and therefore do not. Yeah, we do not forgive predictions. Have you played the web with this chat? I did not probably that no man is insane. It's insane. I've seen a lot of it in the middle. I think is it? I'm trying to still grasp of whether it's actually using that AI as a straight to the internet. As straight to the AI is in the scenes or is it just scouring the internet to grab what it can and I don't know how you result. It's a better Google. But it's unbelievable. So I asked it to write a description for a podcast and I gave it a few prompts. It was the Nate Harmon and Steve Barber. Did we actually use it in the internet? No, why not? Because it wasn't quite good enough. But it was so unbelievably good. Could you just use it? Oh, you could have used it as a basis for the thing and just ask for this one. More user-fiber. Yeah, we used it as well. I also did a one and I was like, give me a series of intelligent questions to ask. No, a unique questions to ask Michael Seder about Bitcoin for an interview. And it came up with like 15 questions or whatever it was. So I'm like, why will it like shit questions? But someone was like, yeah, it's a fucking great question. Like it's insane. Yeah, it is really good. Scary is like a template to start from. I think it actually gives you some quite good stuff. Who won the Bitcoin cup? It didn't say it couldn't do it. What? I said I'm not able to browse web in there for. Don't have any questions. Plus you don't. I'm going to get this shit because it's a certain. So the story of a full match between well, Bedford, FC, and Oxford City. Let's see. That was a whole music. Yeah. Oh, weird. It doesn't like support. It's a ability to create a original content. But I've had to tell the story. Like tell the story of. We could be here for a while. No, you did the story of how I was the down for podcast. Which is true. Pizza, McCormick. You were overloading it with stuff like you were glad. Yeah, I got some talking. You could find what I'm not able to do. It definitely used to do that. If it is AI that we're talking about here, then it's self-learning. It's hopefully going to be learning what you're previously putting, and it'll be adjusting its answers. So it's thinking it shouldn't be doing that. It shouldn't be telling me. Or maybe it's learning in the background. And it's like, right, we should hide this shit. Because it's the rise of the robots. It's scary. It's very scary. This is weird because it was totally doing this. And that was fun. And it was doing poems and stuff like that. Like the old and polo poems, I think. All right. So we'll tell the story. Right, a poem about Oxford City Football Club playing real Bedford. You're the reasonist under too much demand. In Oxford City, an Oxford City of Dream and Spires were history and learning never tired. The football club, known as a use, covered strength to take on their foes. In the field of play, the players met, Oxford in blue, Bedford in white and fleet. The fans are tuning the tiges high as the team's clashing battle for pride. Oxford attacks with Pason Flair, looking to score, to show their force to bear. Bedford defends with heart and soul. Just gives the fucking score. It's not going to be a shame. Before that, it sounds like a bedside. It's the only story. So that's really the glass to the use for their victory of a real but fuck off. That's weird though, because I got it telling some story. I basically just get to tell me a dark story about this. Or tell me a dark story about that, like how down it. And it was like fascinating little stories. That's weird though. It's learning. It's learning. Do you think there's like, yeah, weird? I don't know anyway. So back to lightning payments and adoption. How do we drive an Oscar? How do we drive adoption of remittance? That's a very good reason. Are you down? Are you trying to go? What would daddy think? It would just be me and AI. That's what a whole podcast is. You just talk with Dorian. If you're asking me AI for questions. So you just say AI. But then I can ask the AI to answer the questions. Do you know there's going to be some people listening to this right now. Can this fucking bullshit? I want to learn about learning invoices. I'm so concerned, Danny. There are a few different ways people working on to drive Bitcoin adoption and other cryptocurrencies with that. Yeah, fuck off. All right. So the big thing, the technology works. OK. It saves money. Yep. It's open 24.7. Yep. You don't have to go to a remittance. You don't have to go to a Western unit. You can literally do it sat in your pants on the couch. Yeah. Every single part. Is there any part where the traditional remittance industry is better? I think at the minute for physical gosh, yes, because that infrastructure isn't there yet for Bitcoin. So he wants to get cash the other end. Yeah, that's the one thing they've got. Then I think that is, yeah, which is, as we know, dying out. So that is a dying sector to go. But for most people, there's no logical reason for them not to use what you're using over Western unit. Not of them, I guess the only if they don't have, so it is really the physical gosh side if they didn't have, if they were in Philippines, but they didn't have a bank account. But you know what percentage of people who use in remittance end up with physical cash the other end? Let's ask chat. LAUGHTER That's amazing. Is this a new fact checker? Who's fact checks the AI? I'm just going to ask you a little bit. But whatever the number is, it's a decrease in number. But for anyone who is not needing cash the other end, there is no reason they shouldn't be using yours. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And that's part of, I think, at the minute, it's still scary a little bit. And it's still people obviously don't know about it. People have never used it. They're unsure. Do they actually even know they're using Bitcoin? No. So it's similar to like Strike, even pushing out for a while now, it's like they're trying not to be Bitcoin. They're trying to be dollar, but actually in the background, it's using light into moving money around the world. But some people might want Bitcoin, so how do you do both? It's difficult. Yeah. I think you just got to give customers the option. So you almost have to, like the remittance products, the way you market that, almost has to be, yes, you're moving value around the world of whatever currency to another currency. But then at the same time, if you're advertising, then you're Bitcoin buying service. So once you're just going to buy yourself Bitcoin, you are advertising to a different crowd. And it is completely different audiences each time. Or generally, we'll obviously be crossing over. So you could just open and offers in these countries, a few of these countries. Essentially, yeah, I think the way I'm seeing it in the minute is I've explained this to a couple of people recently with Dave asked me the question, how do we compete with Visa, Mastercard, Western Union, and the likes in all different areas of payments? And the point is, we don't have to. We are in a small piece, but there's lots of concons out there. There's a strike, there's a bit now. There's pouches, all these ones I would talk about that. We're all now starting to build this infrastructure all around the world. We don't need offices in Philippines, because we're out of the pouch of the. So we can interact with pouch and make the payment and they receive it on there. And so whereas we transfer wise, it was a Western Union, there's Western Union in each end, and having to the infrastructure they've had to build out to do that, physical infrastructure, to do that, has been massive. Whereas now, we just don't need that anymore. It kind of fucked really. When you think about it, it's a little bit like, you can think of so many industries. Think of Blockbuster, right? They built out the infrastructure of having all the shops in every major town, so you can go and get your DVD or your video. Do you remember the videos? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you remember the videos? Yeah. Do you remember the videos? Yeah. So, and then I remember that before we had Netflix, it was Love Film, Dream of Love Film. And it was like, oh, you can just have it posted to you. Now that was a bit annoying, because that was kind of like, ah, that was what Netflix was originally. Yeah, it was supposed to. But I always found that annoying, because it was like, well, I have to order it two days early. And I like the experience of going to the shop and flicking through. And that kind of like removes something the infrastructure, but Netflix just destroyed the infrastructure. I sit on my couch in my pants, and I can just surf and find the film I want to watch. Yeah. And essentially, that's what is going to happen to us are union, because they've got the expensive legacy infrastructure that is not required. The thing I, my little quote, I say in the team back on last night is people are lazy. And at the end of the day, without ones who insult people, people are lazy. Innovation is created. Oh, you haven't solved a lazy. And I think it's OK. That's good. Yeah. People are lazy. People are lazy. And if you look back at innovations, they are created off the back of people being lazy. The webcam is always the example I use of the, it was created in Oxford University, I think. And it was purely some tech guys in the university. It couldn't be bothered walking to check if a coffee pot was ready and boiled in another room. So they created the webcam. And so they could watch it and check when it was boiled or when it was empty, I think it was. So they could go and refill. So it was things like that. Innovation technology is created by laziness. And exactly the same there. You can sit at home and watch Netflix. You don't have to go to the video shop anymore. You'll be able to do the same Western Union. You have to get out your house, go and pick up the cash do whatever. Somebody in the UK will be able to sit at home, send in to somebody at home in the Philippines. And they'll be able to sit in both sit on your couch and send the money over to you. And you just receive it instantly. So yeah, it's playing out the way, the way I guess the way I see money movement around the world with Bitcoin and Lightning is playing out similar to what you see and with the blockbusters and all the industries I guess we've seen over the years, I've slowly died out due to not keeping up with innovation. Do I kind of hope this utility builds out to the point where we get rid of bear markets? Yes. I think people, people were speculating on that this time and I think that I was way too early. Way too early. And but yeah, I think that would be really, really interesting because that means it's no longer, it's the hype cycles we've lived and experienced. They are difficult to operate as a business, especially in, I know I think you are Jesse on to New from Cracken the other week and his comments around that and you have these, as the hype cycles go, the businesses follow them hype cycles. So during the bull period, great. We get lots of customers, lots of trades, lots of money bear periods. It's the complete opposite way. And you see in that the minute people are laying off staff all the exchanges. And that is hard to run a business when a lot of the businesses in the industry are venture capital backed and the VCs are looking for returns at some point. So they're trying to effectively force the industry where it's just not ready to be forced and not forced. And I mean, look, you can organically support it. Yep, but you cannot force a doctrine like you can force speculation. No, the speculation hype cycle, they can go crazy, right? But you cannot force a doctrine of Bitcoin as a utility. Yep, outside of that. And that's why I think you'll come be super interesting. I'm out of it. You've not raised money. We can talk about that, right? Now, we raised £150,000 in 2015 from just to high net worth local. So you did some like seed capital, right? Yeah. But you haven't gone like series A, B, C, D. No, you haven't touched a bunch of capital money or institutions. I think that's really cool. And I'm going to say for a couple of reasons. Firstly, you're not under a pressure to have a accelerating growing bank balance, which is of forcing you to take risks. And I think that's maybe what happens to some of these companies, because every round, they want a much higher valuation, therefore with those higher valuations, they need to have more business. And I think a lot of companies have just taken big risks or have witnessed these downrows because of it, because it's just not possible to have that kind of accelerated growth. Yep. So I think it's cool because of that. But I also just think it's cool because you've got the right time preference. Your time preference is matching bitcoins. Yep. And I think, thank you as well. Really appreciate the comments, sir. But yeah, that is the way my mind is and the way I'm wanting to move forwards and the way I've always moved forward is that long term time preference. You're looking at the long term sustainability of the company, not just getting out. And that is unfortunate, the VC world. So looking value world, you see downrounds and downrounds is generally the killer of a lot of companies, traditionally in the VC and the Silicon Valley world. In our industry, I don't think that's quite going to be the same because we have these four year hype cycles. So yeah, I'm actually a original point. I'm looking forward to a time when the cycles slowly come to an end. And we can actually just be using Bitcoin in everyday life. And whether you realize it or not, the an analogy, it lights it sort of it's touch on the first or right with it with bear with me. That's what I'm saying. But I'm. The that was without meaning. So if you look back on the internet, people compare Bitcoin to the internet and you go back to the 90s and people try and compare it. But they're comparing it against users of the internet and users of Bitcoin. When you look at the internet and how the internet grew and initially it was, you know, it was universities around the world sending research papers to each other in data. And then you had emails and you had basic websites. Then you had e-commerce. Then we had like dating and then eventually social media. And then you eventually had smartphones. And like this is going over decades now. And when we're getting to a point where you eventually get to streaming on Netflix. And you on you. I think that was probably back in the 90s. But every single one of them introduced a new wave of customers and a new wave of users. And sometimes I remember my dad's back in like maybe early 2000s, I've ever seen. He doesn't need a computer. He'd never use the internet. Now he uses the internet. I would pretty much guarantee every single day. And whether that's watch and tell you and it's been streamed, whether that's picking up a laptop and you're just straight in the internet. Sure. Now he used to working like IT. So he's always been pretty on it. My dad was pretty bad. So my dad worked for an airline. He was the aircraft engineer. And he was quite late to computers. And then he had to use him for emails. But he now, my dad does online banking. And if you know my dad, that's incredible for him to do something like that. He has a Facebook account. He emails. And then he's like, just put in perspective, my dad only got a phone about five years ago. And mobile. He just didn't have one. So he does it all as well. Eventually, if one gets it. Yeah. And they do it because this is the point earlier on, don't force Bitcoin down people's throats. Give them the utility. Give them that. We, what our version of the smartphone is in a minute, I have no idea in the Bitcoin world and what that might be. What I'm looking at there is like products. So you smartphone or e-commerce or eventually Netflix and streaming in the Bitcoin world, it's probably going to be slightly different to that. And it may not be like, but it's remittance could be one. And FX, money moving around the world. One of the other ones could be like El Salvador adopting it. And that brings in a new wave of users. And it slowly gets there. And each time a new country brings in, it's more and more people every time. And that's kind of our versions of, I guess, like the smartphone and the Netflix. Once the US adopt it in a better capacity, maybe that's our smartphone point in time. And that's where we see more adoption. But that is going to, this is one of the things that people need to understand. And people need to be patient. There's a 40 year timeline I'm talking over there from the internet of starting on the internet to where we are today. That is just going to be in my head, similar capacity to Bitcoin. So we're going to expect, we're 12, 13 years are we in now to Bitcoin. So you've got to think, OK, back then, we're in early mid 90s in terms of technology, advancements in comparison to the internet. So we've got to give it time. And you've got to see in the 5, 10, 15, 20 years for it to really be at the Netflix stage, maybe where you're more than you're grandparents will use it on a daily basis without realizing as well, I think. And that's the key for me. And it's people don't like to hear that, I think. And people don't really want to, they want to happen overnight and tomorrow and their impatient. But the reality is it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time. It's going to be hard. It's going to be not ill battle with regulators and banks and everything else. But in my head, eventually, it gets a, whether that's 10, 20, 30 years time. And that's where we want to aim as a company to be there at that point. So you're very practical about it all. We try to be. Does that mean you sit outside and observe a lot of what's going on in the Bitcoin industry? And you just, are you in-cycle and emulsion in your head? It's a lot of noise. Yeah, definitely. I was telling you guys last night about, don't like going ambulance, Jason, and grave dancing. And that's where things are blowing up and you're jumping on it and doing that, which I don't want to do as a put individual and I don't want to do as a company. Bitcoin or so. Yeah, either one. Yeah. Either one's not good in real. I think FTX going under and on all that side, it's good for the cleanup of the industry, but the negative side of that. And if we keep shouting about that and making a big song and dance about it, Sam has to, in theory, go to jail at some point or something that's happened to him and whatever capacity. But if we keep shouting and making a song and dance about it, it gives the regulators more ammunition to say that these guys are still going on about this. We should calm down. If the people that are working in the industry are singing the song about it, then we should be also clumping down. And it creates a negative perception as well for the outside world. And the more noise we make about that, the worse that gets. So yeah, I'd rather kind of what I try and do, what we try and do is try and ignore a lot of that noise as much as possible and just focus on what we're doing, what we're building, and which direction we can go. We want to find companies around the world that we can work with in the same kind of mindset and the same direction as we're going, which is touched on before with bitnobs and the likes. And we can then drive together and create something together while the noise is happening around us. We just have to kind of ignore it. Well, you guys are pretty much all signal, especially Molly. We try. Like, you always seem to stand up to me when you're doing little demos or showing shit that's happening. Like, that really cool thing that they were passing, if they were going to circle past in a Bitcoin round, it was so cool. Yeah, do you see the El Salvador? Yeah. With Joe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was good. That was something we wanted to do for a while. Did you, we were on that trip. But I can't remember. Yeah. You were. Yeah. I just remember seeing because Molly ran it and I saw it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did you make a Velservil? Was that your first time? No, sorry. I've not been to El Salvador. So you weren't on that trip. No, no, sorry. I thought you said on the video, sorry. No, the Joe Nakamoto was in El Salvador. Yes. And we were just sending to him. I was in the office in the Alabama. And we sent to him. And then he was there and he went and paid his partner. And then he went and paid his partner. Yeah. And he was in the other one. And Molly was in a circle. Yeah. And that was one of the couple of weeks before. Yeah. And we did that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we've done a couple of them where it's just a show. I guess the power of what you can do with lightning. I think one of the big things for education and helping people along in their adoption is actually showing them how something works. Like we don't like announcing something. We do all sorts of announcements. But it's nothing to show. I feel like I can't, like people don't really understand what it is. There's then loads of questions. It creates more questions and problems. And then when you finally release the product, the excitement's kind of gone because everybody already kind of knew it was coming in. They're not bothered. So we always like to try them every time we want to release the products. We don't shout about it. Keep it quiet. And then we'll shout about it in action. They're working. So we've done that all the way through. And we want to keep doing that. I guess it's more authentic, I'd say. And I don't like letting people down, I guess, and something. We shout about something that doesn't happen. Which happens all the time. You know, there's so many in the background things that we've come very close to. And a lot of the companies do similar. And you can't. It's out your control a lot of time. Now you're hands. It's no one's fault. But these things sometimes you don't get my little line for X, Y's Ed reasons. And yeah, I think I've learned my lessons over the years of not to get too excited and shout about something. And originally we would have done that. But now I think we've learned that to wait until it's over line. It's live. And then we can shout about it. I'm going back to the other man and then drive a merchant adoption and usage out there. When you get a merchant to accept Bitcoin, can it be that they only get maybe one or two transactions a week? And how do they feel about that? And I ask for a reason because I'm obviously thinking, we have Bitcoin beige, Bitcoin Lake and Guatemala, Bitcoin Island original. I'm thinking about that for them driving adoption. I'm going around my town and trying to introduce it. But I can imagine going into a place in. Yeah, you should accept Bitcoin and they do it. And then nobody comes in. How much is what kind of requirement? What kind of burden does it put on them to accept it? Okay. Reality check again. Reality check. Yeah, it's adoption is very, very difficult in terms of payments in person, especially even the payments online. In the other man, for example, yeah, we onboarded very quickly 50 physical pointers, sort of point and say, oh, shops where you can go and pay with Bitcoin. You are right. They may only get like one or two orders a week, some of them. So there's a few and far between. And if they some of them may go for a couple of weeks without an order because nobody's going there and no Bitcoin is going there. And we have quite a lot of Bitcoin is on the island as well for the size of the island. There's quite a good density of them. So how did you get other meat upside? Um, it varies. We do, because we do like a weekly lunch thing. I might be like 10, 15 people. And then we'll do the monthly or every couple of months. There'll be more like towards 50 maybe. Yeah, but yeah, kind of cycles around really. And for how many people come. So there's, yeah, there's a number of companies there now that are in industry and then a lot of other people just that have moved there. It's going to live there for most of the time capital gains tax purposes. And they've come and set up there and the literature just come here living there. And some of them don't work, but the just Bitcoin is that I come in and settle in down. Um, but yeah, sorry, the adoption. Um, it's definitely, um, I like, we've done that initially for the bulk card and to show people that you can the familiar area. Of what you can do with contact cards and you can make that payment. And we onboarded all the merchants they came on board because we had that card before that card explaining to them about accepting Bitcoin was so alien. It was so complicated. They didn't stand scanning QR codes and like from the UK perspective, we're just not used to that. Yeah. So with that familiarity of the bulk card and the contactless payments, that became such an easy sell. So we onboarded and very easy and very quickly at that point. What new infrastructure do they require? And what from what to accept it or is it really just about them accepting a card? Just, yeah, they just have to have an app on the phone. Right. Okay. They can look through just have a corner app on the phone. They can have and breeze while it works with their POS version loads of other ones. And so they just, but there is a set of sets of kebab and they put in five pound and that person taps. Yeah. So an interesting point on that is this is one of the things that's frustrating for me. So we use at the full club we zettle for our point of sale. Yep. And we have all our merch in there and we have all our stock in there. And what's really cool is we've got a game next Saturday, I will go in and I'll have a note. Do you know Zettle? Yep. So I'll go in here. Right. Here we go. So here's all our stock and I can go into inventory and then go down here. Right. I've got no bags of Maltesers. I've got only seven cans of John Smiths. I've got no cans of Stella. So and I can just go to cash and carry and stock up and you know, we have it there. And then when it's really cool, when I do want to do a sale, I go like this. Yeah, I sold a pint of beer and I've sold pack of Chris. I go to charge them and I can take the cash card and pay upon all managers. Yep. But when I accept Bitcoin, I have to go to a separate system. Yep. Take the payment, which is super quick. And then we have to have on a piece of paper, we have to write down what the sale is. And at the end of the day, I have to go in and take that off the inventory. Yep. Okay. But it's fine. Yeah. But it's also, it's not marked as a sale. So when I go and look, it's just a deduction in the inventory. So when I go and look at the reports of what we sold that day, I won't get it from there. So I have to do a manual report separately in Excel or I take it from there and do my Bitcoin. It's annoying. Yeah. When do you think we get to the point where someone like Zettle, I just want to have Bitcoin on there. Yeah. That's what it needs. And that is when I come up to the legacy of Peacetimab, but what you say when you go and pay in a shop and you've got a point in sale device, which is a card machine, and you've got you can tap your visa or Mastercard, and it just knows. Eventually, it'll, the idea is it'll be Bitcoin as well. So you'll be able to tap your card or tap your phone, and it'll pay in Bitcoin, Visa or Mastercard. And the customer doesn't, the merchant doesn't need to know which one, because, you know, when you go into a shop and they say, oh, you're paying the card, do you say it's a Visa card? You don't, you just tap and pay in an off you go. So eventually, that needs to be embedded like you're saying there. They need to be a Bitcoin option, and it actually just naturally works. If we spoke to Zettle, and they're like, yeah, cool, we want to do this, and they're a Bitcoin button. Yeah. Would it be very easy for them to integrate with you? Would you like an API call when you're displaying something being done? Yeah. It's pretty. We've just done our first legacy integration with the POS provider. They're fairly small, one of them in a bit. They've got about 100,000. Who are they? They're all the POS machines. It's more company than the UK. Not an answer to the name yet. Okay. I'm sorry. You can tell me afterwards. Yes. But they, I've put a video out with two, two, three. Is it basically that? Yes. So their POS system, so like, very much, yeah, you're going to a pub and most of these are pubs, and it's got the pub POS system, and you'll pick your drinks and everything else, and it's got all the stock taking everything in there, and then when you come to payment, you can pay card or Bitcoin, and you click Bitcoin, and it's got one, and I've see adaptor. So we could just sack off Zettor and just go with them. Yeah. You could do. Tell me who is afterwards. Okay. I'll see you can't say on that. Yeah. And I will have a look into it. But there's lots and there's more of them working with quite a few others at the minute. Not again, I'm just doing contracts in myself here now, announcing something that's not already. You're announcing an announcement. Yeah. But that's coming in the background is kind of where I'm getting to. The adoption is coming there, but it takes a long time. And this small one is took by many months to nine months, whatever it's been of initial conversations to where we are now, and it's still probably going to be a battle on the month or two before we get live and in a physical shop with that. So these things just take time. And the adoption going back to the original point, yeah, the UX, especially the Alabama workshops, merchants, what exactly what we've seen from our Salvador from a distance in these last couple of weeks, and people are going into it to the shop, saying, can I pay a Bitcoin, pulling out a phone or a device, trying to charge it up because they forgot to charge it because they don't get many orders. And the user experience is terrible for the consumer and for the merchant. And a big part of that is because there's not enough people regularly going and paying. So even though we onboard all of the merchants, it doesn't mean to say that the consumers are going to come. So you've then got the problem of if the consumers are not coming, then the merchants are going to start switching off is what happens. And we've seen that historically exactly the same years ago, back in 2014, 2015, we onboarded a few back then and then people start to pay in because the hype cycles disappeared. Yeah, you've got a chicken and egg problem as well. Like the club, most gains we don't get any Bitcoin transactions, unless a couple of round of Bitcoiners have come in and they would do it. But the days where we have a meetup before the game, we take hundreds of pounds in Bitcoin because all the Bitcoiners want to be in Bitcoin. And it's such a hard chicken and egg. And I think what you've got to do is fast forward to go and buy this time preference of take a step back and look at the bigger scale and look at say 10, 15, 20 years in the future, you say you get your Barclays, your NAP West and NAP West and you've got 6 million customers with a Visa debit card out there, that Visa card eventually could just be a Bitcoin back card like a bulk card lighting card. And they can effectively give that to their customers because all the merchants around the country accept it and use it. So at that point, it doesn't matter if the car Visa or a Mastercard or a Bitcoin card, they will be able to go and tap and pay and it'll just pull from their bank accounts. So that's the point where it's no longer forced. It's in some point forced on the customers and the consumers of NAP West for example, but it's now just another version of Visa, Mastercard, you've got my strokes, you've got American Express. It's another version of that and the customer doesn't really do care if your bank, you get a Visa or a Mastercard, which one is, it doesn't really make a difference. So eventually the banks as they start to adopt Bitcoin and infrastructure and make the payments from a Bitcoin lightning perspective, they will then eventually, the market will dictate which one they go with, will they go with Visa or will they go Mastercard because of the pricing or will they go with Bitcoin lightning because maybe it's slightly cheaper now and it's not restrictive of what they can do and how they can operate the business. So that the market, I guess, will dictate which one, I'm going to say wins at the end because they'll run in parallel for many, many years, I'm sure. But that is the way I would see it taking that step back and seeing. That is where your football club is better, people come in and pay them, they'll be coming in and paying the Bitcoin without you and thinking about it and realizing, but still we are 10, 15, 20 years off that happening. But we have to build infrastructure in place now and build out. So in the meantime, we're building that out. We need to find the current use cases around the world, which comes back to remittance and FX and when you've been around the world. In the meantime, you keep building then products out and making use of it and every time you're making use of that and the remittance products, for example, that's pulling in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people eventually, they all then start to get comfortable with Bitcoin. And then over time, they start using it in different ways, different capacities and that then drives next waves of adoptions. So that's the way I guess I look at it in the way I'm looking at Bitcoin in this long-term timescale and not this short-term hype cycle of avoiding. You're very patient, I still have this guy, very patient. I'm conscious I just really want to support everything you do. And I said it to you earlier, I feel like we've neglected the UK and I've often gone to Edinburgh. I feel like we want to do a bit more and I know you guys have been working super hard here and you've been doing some great stuff and I feel like if we can help you with a can, but is there anything we should not talk about you want to get into? I've got the cards, would you like a little present? Yeah, show us. So we've got these at the bulk card. No way. I didn't know you were doing this. So we've done this all myself. We've been doing these for a while. How did you fucking go? We're not pleased of purely one-off run for you guys. Okay, so there's more in the back down there. So, for people listening, Danny Scott is a legend. He has handed me these railroad bedfered bulk cards, explain the bulk card to people listening. So the bulk card similar to what we're talking about there with the Visa Mastercard, it's a contactless card that you can go and tap on a POS device, a Bitcoin POS device, and it will make a lightning payment effect to make the payment rather than the Visa or Mastercard rails. So how do I load up? So that's what we can show you. Right, let's do it. So this set list looks so staged. This is a surprise, no. This is cool. I live down all of that. It's never going to work, but we'll see. So in the coin corner app, you can go on to your cards. I don't know if I should go that way. You can go into the cards and then you've got your bulk card, which is the kind of like your debit card as such, tied to your account. So I can then tap and pay with that. Or you can set up a gift card. So if I set up a gift card, 2000 satson, I click Create. And now I'll say, tap the card on the phone and tap the card. And it's done. So you've got 2000 satson there ready to go. You see that, Sean? That's that now that instantly has money on it. So you can. The, what I was giving you these guys into these four is help with the club you want to help with players get to Bitcoin things. Maybe a good Christmas gift for top them up with some free sats. So how do I know where I can spend this? It's generally there's a website out there that you can go to and it'll show you all the different places like to have Bitcoin. It's few and far between in the UK at the minute. The other man is more dense. So there's plenty in the other man. So if we wanted to accept it at the club, what app do I need? You can use Concorn as POS without wanting to show that. You can use what's Tashi works with it, Breeze, BTC pay server works with it. Pretty much any lightning wallet these days now is compatible with that. Wow. That is super cool. Thank you. You can tap that on your phone to get the balance, right? You can tap it and sweep it into any of your light. Do it if you do it now. You got lightning wallet. Just any lightning wallet. If you tap on your phone, it'll pop up with the wallet. There we go. Zippity NSC tag. Yes. It's a default to Zippity. Sometimes your phones dictate which one you can go to. Zippity is that gaming thing I told you about. But anyway, that's very, very cool. Now that's sweet to start straight into whichever wallet you've got. Can I switch what it defaults to? I don't know if this is an ongoing question online at the minute. Everybody's got this problem. iPhone seems to pick one and the Android didn't used to and Android's kind of started doing that a little bit now. Yeah. I have to do that on mine. Because it used to be blue wallet was my default. Just tap on the back of mine. And that'll then pop up and give you all different wallets that we can. That's compatible with. That's so cool. These are so cool. Thank you, Danny. Welcome. You can't have. Are you still? Got it. That is very, very cool. Okay, very cool. Thank you, appreciate that. The innovation you're welcome as well. I think the innovation for that is the highlight piece of what it took from early around. We released these in May and people are creating things off the back of them. All the wallets are compatible with them. There's just so many different. We saw one the other day who I'll come with the name of it now. It's one for electric charging points. And if you see that one going around Europe. And he's actually using one of our bulk cards, which can also be dual use over some. So you can tap it and take the user ID effects away from that and charge his car from it from one of the charging points. So it's not using a Bitcoin light in payment. It's just using the information that's on there. But that in itself is like your Visa Mastercard. But you can now set your Visa Mastercard yourself. You don't have to wait for your bank to send you on and wait six weeks and so on. You can tap on your phone and set that up off you go and use it. And it doesn't have to be a card. It can be ring. It can be sticker. It can be all sorts. Anything else you can pass. It would be cool when lots more play. You can go almost anywhere and just go tap. Yeah. Yeah. And that's where we need the legacy integrations really because they're the ones that have the last merchants. And we need to build that infrastructure out. But again, time preference. It's going to take time. So I have actually once had somebody at the club ask him a pay with bolt. Oh, and I was like, I don't know how to do it. I got to be the Danny. And so, yeah, so I'll have a look into us being able to accept these as well at the club. You'll do that. That's very cool. Thank you, man. There's more down there as well. Oh, you got loads of this. Yeah. Just one offer for you guys. So I might give one to each of the players. Yeah. So you're like, 20 bucks a bit going on it. Yeah. And listen, look, Danny, you've got an open invite to come on the show whenever you want to support you and help you. Everything you're money are doing. So anything just gives the chat. Let us know. Thank you. And we'll push this out. Where do you want people to go? If they want to find out more. Twitter is always conconed, Danny. Concon account. The whole team is conconed and followed by their names. So you'll find them easy enough. And conconed.com, if you have any interest, just reach out to me. And any questions? I'll answer away. And if you want to come down and do a meetup and explain these, we do one a month at the club. And we need to organize the Bitcoin cup between railroad bed food and we do sit. We don't pay their first team just yet. They're a bit above us. But open invitation to Oxford City that. Yeah. Definitely. Give them a kick. We have. I think we briefly spoke to them about that. So yeah, we'll see what we can do. We played a game at their ground last year. Because somebody else, they've got to have three or four. They've got to have three or four. And they're a bit above us. But open invitation to Oxford City that. Yeah. I think we briefly spoke to them about that. So yeah, we played a game at their ground last year. Because they've got to have three G pitch, haven't they? Yeah. It was our last game in the season because they were playing there as well. So we've been to the ground. And I kind of feel in my manager Rob played for Oxford City. We're feeling. There we go. Anyway, listen, anything you need gives a shout. Come to a meetup. Stay in touch. We'll come to the Iron Man. Come and check it out. And yeah, and just good luck keep doing what you're doing. I love it. I love the time preference that you're working to. I love what you're building out. So thank you for coming in and good luck. Same to you guys as well. Thank you very much.
