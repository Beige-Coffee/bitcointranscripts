 Good morning, Jameson. Good morning. Get to see you again. How many times are recorded in person? Just a sad one. That sounds about right. Might have done a few remote interviews as well. Yeah, it's a very different setup from the fast times, where it was just me and my little trunnie. To be fair, you were the first person that ever actually brought professional equipment. I was like, who is this guy who's flying thousands of miles to set up like a professional studio in my home? Well, it wasn't as professional as this. And we didn't have producer Danny. We didn't have Jeremy did it all on my own. We should tell that story. I think we've told him for a tell-it again for people to don't know. So that's my third ever show. That was when was it Danny? December 2017. So it was five years ago. My third episode. So I was inspired to make the podcast by this guy, Rich Roll, who did all his interviews in person. So I was like, I'm going to do the morning person. So my first one when I was in LA would look Martin. Now I was in the UK and I did it with Trader. Coincradinate. Coincradinate. And then this, like, it's a famous picture of you. You know the picture. You should, we'd love to flash that up. I see this dude on Twitter with his huge beard, a massive gun and a meat bitcoin grade again hat. And I was like, I need to interview this guy. So I just went on your website. And I emailed you and I can't remember the email. I wonder if we could find that. Oh, I'm sure I can find it out. Really? Oh, we should dig that out. I'm sure there's something on the lines of, oh, you've launched the podcast. Can I come in and interview you offline from the UK and can you take me to shoot a gun? And I turn up at your house and there are fucking guns everywhere. How many guns would there have been? Oh, dozens. Yeah. And bear in mind, I'd never seen a gun before. And so you took me shooting. You made a podcast? Got some barbecue. You should tell that story as well. Yeah. So you made me talk about it. Sorry. I know I'm into you, Jameson. I was a vegan at the time because my mom, I got to get the dates right. But anyway, I went vegan. And you took me to this barbecue place and I was sitting there thinking, fuck, you know, I can't. I don't tell where I'm to this guy with big guns and bitcoin and say, I'm a vegan. Can I have some potato without, I could even have the salad. I'm sure there were a couple of options, but I had to take you to a real, authentic hole in the wall barbecue shack in North Carolina. Well, that was the day I stopped being a vegan because I was like, I can't do this. And I was like, actually, it's good. Actually, do you know what really I remember from that? Do you remember there was an old guy in there I was talking to? I can't find the full picture, but it was this one, wasn't it? Oh, yeah. You got to find the one with the gun, though. Yeah. You can definitely find the one, you know, Peter Thiel actually put me in the metallic in his presentation at bitcoin in 2022. So you don't remember the old guy in there? Uh, vaguely not really. So I was chatting to this old guy in there and he was like, were you from boy? He's like, I'm from bed with his new London. And he was like, and he was chatting away and I was like, I remember saying to him like, oh, have you ever been? And he said something along the lines of, I've never left the county. You wasn't, right? I haven't, there's not, I haven't left the state. He'd never left the county. Oh, there we go. Look at that, man. What a fucking badass. Oh, uh, although you do look like somebody would have gone to the, um, capital building on January the 6th. Yeah, you know, it's, it's a funny story how that all worked out, right? Is it, you know, things take a life of their own and the fact that I did this as a satirical video on request for someone. Nobody knows that anymore. Even you probably don't know that. No, no, I did this for Bitcoin car talk. Um, I'm way back in the day. Was that Mike and spent Mike in my, yeah, Mike and space. I can space, yeah. Yeah. And so I did this way over the top, you know, hilarious sort of gunned up Bitcoin maximalist video and he put it in the intro to Bitcoin car talk, one of those episodes. And of course, people took screenshots of it. And then my favorite, of course, is the people who transpose this against Vitalik wearing his like, you know, porn, pajama, ones, you think. Um, but you know, these, these things are all just memes. And that's one of the hilarious things about this space is the memetics of it. Have you seen this picture before? Yeah. You look like a fucking badass. I mean, the glasses, the hat, the gun, you look like a hamer. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of hard to tell. Yeah. But you'd also do look like a January the 6th. I love that picture. That was a very early show we made and I came to ask you technical stuff. And honestly, I had no fucking idea what you're talking about. Well, hopefully you've learned a little sense, then a little bit. I don't know why I'm ex-part, but I'm not an extended public here. Anyway, dude, welcome back. It's good. Oh, we recorded another time in person in New York in that little studio. Was that around one of the consensus conferences? Yes. That was one of my first in person interviews with the camera. We rented the studio and then we went and got burgers. Yeah. Long time ago, man. Well, listen. Thank you very much for doing that interview because you said yes. And that essentially kick-started getting known incredible Bitcoin people because, all right, it's like going, but that you got me then Charlie Lee and Charlie Lee got me so and so. And that started the whole journey. So you did the hard work? Yeah, but you said yes. That was the easy part. Yeah, but it isn't really because I imagine, yeah, in various times you've had lots of requests. But I very rarely say no. I don't feel surprised. A lot of people said no early on or a lot of people didn't reply. But getting that yes was like a big deal. That show was a credible show that went out and gave me credibility. So I owe you a debt of gratitude for that and various things. So thank you, Jameson. Yeah, welcome back. How things it cost. Yeah, typical bear market shenanigans, but people are hodling. And so that's good. I mean, from a business perspective, Casa compared to a lot of the other businesses in the space, you know, we're a subscription service. So that has pros and cons. The pros are you have some fairly reliable annual revenue. And so we don't get hit as hard as the people who are doing BIPs or, you know, basically taking a cut of some other activity. That's good during the bear markets. The downside is that we don't see the same, you know, straight up a wall type of revenue increases during the crazy hype cycles. So give and take. Yeah, I mean, like on the subscription, I mean, it's not cheap for the package I have. You have a gold platinum in a, yeah, we have a diamond. We have a couple premium tiers that are thousands of dollars a year and then are sort of baseline gold tier is about a hundred and twenty a year. Yeah, I mean, it's a big jump for some people to make that step. And I found with Casa one, I had it for a while before I used it like that first step of going through the process and setting up your multi-seag, it's actually really easy. Once you've done it, it's super easy. People are afraid. Yeah, because it's, you know, for like people like me are non-technical, a wallet is a big step, like a hardware wallet. The word multi-signature, like is actually, is that two words? Yeah, but it's one word is multi-seag. You can hyphenase it. I can do it one word and this fluid, this fluid term, it's kind of intimidating. So what do you mean? I have to sign with multiple keys and I have to add multiple keys and that logic of where you put your keys. So we'll get into that. I'm going to talk about the Ethereum thing. Sure. I'm not critical, but I am interested in the motivations, the impact of that. I saw the criticism, obviously, died down, whatever. I have sponsors who have support multiple coins. You know, some chicions doesn't bother me. We do know there's a section of the community who we react. Oh yeah, completely predictable. Yeah. But I do have an important question which I'll come to, but do you want to talk about why you did it, any of the challenges? Impact. Yeah, well, actually the challenges, there's nothing really new on the challenges side in comparison to what I wrote in 2017 when I was working at BitGo and we developed multi-signature Ethereum wallet. There were a lot of challenges then. They're pretty much the same today. The main difference is that we have another five years of experience to look at standards and best practices of doing multi-sign and Ethereum. And we didn't want to roll our own anything. We didn't want to become smart contract developers. So we're using a well-vetted smart contract that's already securing untold billions of dollars worth of Ether and other tokens and stuff. But why did we do it? Well, it's all about markets, right? And so some people find this very hard to believe, but there are a lot of people out there who own both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And of course, a lot of other things, there's a long tail distribution and you start to get into challenging business questions of deciding where the threshold is of what makes sensitive support. But suffice to say over the past few years, we started losing more and more deals because we didn't support Ethereum and it hurts as a business to lose deals. And from a self-custody perspective, the thing that really irks me is when I see, and I've seen a lot of people do this, they end up choosing a trusted third-party custodian because that's the easiest way for them to secure many different assets. And that's what, I mean, it just makes me cringe and it makes me angry. And so from my perspective, everything that I've ever said about Ethereum, I completely stand by, feel free to go back through any of my blog posts or podcasts or whatever. My personal beliefs about Ethereum and its issues are still there, but I recognize that there are people who don't agree with that and they have this need. And I would rather see them self-custody their Ethereum if that means that they're also going to be self-custody in their Bitcoin. So I haven't seen the Ethereum into Facebook that don't own any or in any tokens, but is it just Ethereum or does it support the tokens as well? Oh, the smart contract that we're using could support definitely any ERC-20 token and possibly other stuff, but that's further down the line. Yeah. We start out with the Ethereum token because that's what people are demanding. Yeah, because I can imagine the only scenario I can imagine I was using it is if I wanted to store some stablecoin dollar. Yes, and I think that that is a logical next step. I would say stablecoins are probably our next greatest thing that we have received demand for. And once again, there are people in the space who will say stablecoins are terrible and you're essentially bringing fiat into the space which we don't need. But on the other hand, there's plenty of examples of utility and stablecoins helping people. I don't know if it's fucking ludicrous. Like the world runs on fiat. Yes, we want to move to Bitcoin. If I lived on a Bitcoin standard entirely, my wealth would have been crushed this last eight months and I would have struggled to pay my team on the business. So I just think that's fucking legal. Oh yeah, we could do a whole episode about stablecoins and all the problems with them. They have, of course, all the problems inherent with fiat and then they usually have a lot of centralization and security model problems too. But nonetheless, people have used for them. Well, I could imagine a scenario because I have to balance between the amount Bitcoin of fiat I hold. It's like, again, it's a fluid balance. I have a both. But I can imagine, I know in the UK, I'm only protected up to 85,000 pounds. I can imagine a scenario where I want to de-risk some of that and maybe hold some in a stablecoin on a multi-sick. There's a logical reason to do that. I don't do it at the moment. But I can certainly see a stronger requirement for that in more challenging markets, challenging countries. So, like, it makes a logical sense. There's a lot of people in South America who absolutely love the relied depend on stablecoins. And so I think the logic's there. The important question really is, so the thing with me and Danny were talking about this morning, as a Bitcoiner using Casa for both of my football club and personally, can the introduction of a Ethereum present any risk to my Bitcoin or is there a separation within the stack of the code? Right. So as with anything, it depends on the implementation. Okay. I would say with a lot of the wallets out there that support a long list of assets, most of them tend to be software-based wallets. Now there are hardware wallets, of course, that support many different things. But it really comes down to what is managing the keys themselves. So with Casa, of course, we have a separation of many different concerns and we use diversity of different software and hardware. And the main sticking point of like, why does introducing other code into the Casa app, not degrade your security with your Bitcoin? And that's because whenever you're having to make a transaction, you're having to go to these different hardware devices and actually verify the details of exactly what you're signing. So of course, anything is possible if enough things go wrong. But it's like if you have both a treasure and a ledger as part of your setup, how would it be that you would go to sign a Bitcoin transaction and those signature operations would create some other thing that you're not. And anticipating, both of those companies and their whole software stacks and firmware and upgrade process that would all have to be compromised. At the end of the day, anything can be compromised. We're just trying to make it as difficult as possible for that to happen. So the short version is that you're verifying what you're doing and you're not trusting the Casa software. Yeah. I mean, I'm staying with Casa. Love the product. I've always loved the app, but even early on when it was Jeremy Welch run the company, I said to him, you're UX is incredible. Like it's not like a Bitcoin company. It's like Silicon Valley company and make for a more unlike me and me, it's super easy to manage a multi-sick. So I love it. I'm staying with the product. But what I really want to do, I ask is because there has to be a decision there. You have to, you knew what you're going to face. Where is this ideology around Bitcoin only? Like I've ignored that myself in what we do in that we're a Bitcoin only podcast. But like we will discuss a theorem if it brings something relevant to the conversation with Bitcoin or we've discussed Monero if it brings something relevant to the conversation with Bitcoin. Or I'll have sponsors who support alternative coins because if that enables us to be able to deliver this message in a Bitcoin, we accept that. But I've lost listeners because of it. There's people who will not listen to my podcast because of that. And I don't know if you can tell me, but my expectation is you lost some customers because I saw some people saying online, well, I've quit. I will no longer use it. Was that a negligible amount? Can you talk about that? Probably won't go into numbers, but I will say that what you see and hear on Twitter is greatly magnified versus reality. Most of the people who are outraged on Twitter, assuming they're actually people, I have some evidence that there's some bots and civil stuff going on. I'm not of course saying that all of these Twitter accounts are bots and a number of them are real people. But trying to remember actually, I think Nick Carter described them as sort of perpetually outraged grievance mob or something. I know I'm screwing up his definition there, but the people who they want to complain about stuff all the time and perhaps they're doing it for cloud, perhaps it's just part of their tribalism. I fully could also be honest held beliefs. Oh, definitely. I understand the whole toxic Twitter tribe stuff. I've played a toxic Bitcoin maximalist on several occasions myself. I'll take it into the... Yeah, and I get it. And we of course expected to lose some customers from a business perspective. We of course are operating under the thesis that we are growing the umbrella and growing our total addressable market and that the hardliners who have the ideological considerations, we wish them the best and they're going to go support the Bitcoin only companies. The only thing that kind of irked me was some of the discussions around people saying that this was degrading the security model for a toxic client. It's very hard to offend me, but that is one of the things that I do get offended by is when people say that I am putting other people's funds at risk. I mean, COSA eats its own dog food. We use COSA for our own corporate treasury. Our employees use COSA. This is a friends and family operation. The claim that I would degrade the security of Bitcoiners just as a sort of cash grab to try to get Ethereum market share is offensive to me. Some people are going to believe that they're going to say that and there's nothing I can do to stop that. But we are going forward with this. There's no arguing against it at this point. We've been committed to it for over six months, probably nine months of research and development. It's a bad idea. Maybe we won't get a significant amount of business from it. Maybe it goes so terribly that we decide that some years in the future that we drop support for it. Anything is possible. This is a fluid environment. We're going to be actually, I think, wire just announced that they were shutting down operations or their future is definitely in peril. We use wire for our buy Bitcoin stuff in the app. Just likely that's going to be going away. I don't know whether or not we're going to be replacing them with someone else. It's hard to say. But that's a wire we're in trouble. Yeah. I think they had like a $1.5 billion buyout that was supposed to happen and then that fell through and now apparently everything seems to be falling apart. But that's the nature of the space. Is it a US 1.5 billion or you were a shit? 2022 was a terrible year to be an investor in this space. But 2022 was a great year to be a technologist. That is the optimistic take that I'm walking away from last year with. Thankfully, I consider myself a technologist first. All of the other stuff is tangential and a result of my interest in different technology. That also comes full circle to the fact that by many people's definition, I'm a shit coiner. I have been called a shit coiner. Probably two outrage incidents a year for the past four or five years. This is because I play around with any technology that interests me. And due to my audience, whenever I talk about any technology, if there's any kind of even possible financial incentive there, if I even talk about it, then I'm considered as shilling that technology. You're a shit coiner. You're a shit coiner. You're a shit coiner. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so that was an outrage incident three or four years ago where I was running a grand node and apparently that meant that I was shilling it and saying that people should be buying and selling it. But I never bought or sold it. I don't even know where I would have. None of the exchanges I had a count on even had grid support. So I never got listed on anything. I don't think so. Yeah. And I had terrible economics. Like no one who looked into the economics would have invested in it. For my me wasn't it like they had a different way of approaching privacy. Yeah, it was a privacy coin. It was using member wimble and I've been talking about member wimble as a protocol. Since probably 2015, you know, when it was the first white paper from member wimble came out. And I guess that's the short version is that anyone out there should expect that I will be interested in almost anything that is going to increase privacy. So if there's a new shit coin that comes out and that it claims to have the best privacy ever in the world that you can bet that I'm going to be looking into it and playing around with it and might be talking about it. It doesn't mean it's investment advice. Yeah, listen, look, I think it's fine. And also look, I mean, I like if you laid out your criticisms of Ethereum, I probably agree with them. Yeah, I think it has been a platform which has been used to spread a lot of shitty projects and shitty ideas. I'm not fan of NFTs. I am not a fan of ICOs anymore. Which makes a lot of loads of money on them. I'm just not really a fan of it. But I do find it hard to argue against stable coins and their usage. We don't have, I don't believe we have a usable, decent stable coin of Bitcoin. And it's very hard to argue against that, especially in me, Tall Talex Gladstone. It's always about how people in these countries are using stable coins. And even if one of the Bitcoiners like, well, no, they should be using Bitcoin. I actually just think it's a moronic statement because these people are already challenged maybe by high inflation or capital controls. This is an option for them and people will refer to the tool that's available. So it doesn't bother me. I'm shouting at people about Ethereum is not making it go away. And we will be seeing stable coins on Bitcoin, you're un-lightening. And we will be seeing the same crowd of people then decrying the fact that people are using Bitcoin for fiat operations. Mate, mate, well, I think that would be a subset. Yeah. I think, again, most normal, I think people who criticize stable coins on any platform, my expectation is they live a privileged life and don't understand the difficulties that other people have. I think people will always find a tool that helps them. But my analogy for this is people don't really like it. But my analogy for you guys supporting Ethereum is kind of like cigarettes. In that, you can absolutely hate Ethereum and still use Casa. Just as you can absolutely hate cigarettes and still go to the liquor store and buy a bowl of whiskey. It is just something you don't like, you don't agree with, a market that's lied about what it is, what it represents that has some kind of negative connotations attached with it. But you can just not buy it. You go and buy your bowl of whiskey and leave it not by any cigarettes. You can go and multi-sig with Casa and store your Bitcoin. I'm not buying Ethereum. Yeah, I think the short version is that I will never apologize for and I will never feel bad about helping people improve their security regardless of what that is. Even if it's security for an asset that I'm not interested in and that a lot of people hate, the YouTube is going to be on fire. Okay. Can we talk about Luke Dasha and what happened this week? We can try. Okay, big outrage onto it. Also, some horrible dunking, which I didn't like at all. My main issue with it was I know what the fuck he was talking about. Okay, yeah, storing Bitcoin for me is very simple. Some people do an exchange, some people do it on a software wallet on their phone, some people do it on hardware wallet, some people have multi-sig. When he explained to scenario what went wrong, I just fundamentally didn't understand. He talked about PGP. I tried to use PGP. It's not more unfriendly, right? It's very tricky tool to use. So I didn't understand it. So I'm just going to like throw to you, talk me through what happened. Well to kind of set the stage, our information is incomplete. So even anything that I'm going to say is somewhat speculative and based upon partial information and tweets and a few conversations that I've seen. So take anything that I say with a grain of salt because it could be wrong. But my understanding is that Luke had a setup that actually dated back 10 years. He said that he had generated these keys in 2012. So that means this is pre-hierarchical deterministic wallet. Pre-seed phrase, it's just a bunch of keys. And a hierarchical deterministic wallet is seed phrases. Yes. So this is most likely he had a Bitcoin core wallet.dat file that had just a bunch of private keys in it. And it sounds like what he was doing was he was securing that by encrypting it with PGP. So at rest, this big data blob, which if anybody got a hold of that data blob, they couldn't do anything with it because you have to have the decryption key to actually be able to get the data and then use the private keys related to it. Now at some point a few months ago, he started talking about one or more of his servers being compromised. What we don't know is how the servers got compromised. Some theories are that there was an insider employee attack at his data hosting provider who physically accessed his server. Some people are speculating that it could have been some sort of software exploit, some sort of vulnerability. But the speculation is that that most likely was sort of entry point into what eventually turned into the compromise of his coins. What we don't know is exactly where he was keeping that wallet file. Most likely I think it was on one or more of his computers at his home, not on his server from what I've seen him talk about. That's still a hot environment. Yeah, I mean, it's still an internet connected computer, which you generally we would call that a hot wallet, even though the keys were encrypted at rest. And so what we don't know is how that attacker, assuming it's the same attacker, which seems likely, how that attacker got from compromising his server to compromising his home machines or whatever machines the actual keys were kept on. The PGP key. And the wallet itself. But he did say at some point his PGP key got compromised. Presumably that was not on the server and that was also on his home machines. And if that was the key that he was also using to encrypt the wallet file, that would have been a game over. Or if he had some other really long decryption phrase for the wallet file, if his machine that he was using to access it had a key logger, then eventually once he decided to open up and decrypt that wallet, then the attacker would have had everything. So let's go into the Jamies and Lock world. My expectation is you have something that scans your computer to look for key logins and things like that. Is that possible? Does that exist? Well, it depends, right? So I actually don't have any antivirus that I run. I mean, all of my machines are Linux machines. They're generally fairly hardened. But also I don't keep any key material on them. So even my PGP keys, for example, I don't actually have those on my laptops or my other machines. I keep those on a Yubiki, which is just another dedicated device that does nothing except hold secrets. So this is another thing getting back to Luke. It sounds to me like he was not using dedicated hardware devices for any of his key material. His PGP key material, his wallet key material. I think most people would agree that had he been using dedicated devices that you're not internet connected devices, then that would have mitigated this attack. But for various reasons, I won't speak for him. Luke does not believe in using hardware devices for his key material. I would love to ask him that question and find out what the answer is. So if you're storing a PGP key or a Yubiki, at some point if you want to transfer some Bitcoin in a hot environment, you have to either type it out or paste it. Yeah, they're the two options. Well, if we tried to apply using a Yubiki for what we believe Luke's setup was, if he had his wallet file encrypted with his PGP key, then he would run an operation or he would run a command to decrypt those keys and instead of past phrase to decrypt them, his Yubiki would have to insert that into the computer and then it would start blinking and you have to physically tap it in order to access it and do that decryption off. I'm thinking if his machine is compromised, a key logger would be able to note the keys that be impressed. Are there also no copy and paste? This is what has been pasted. Oh, yeah, anything that's copy and paste, anything that is input or output from the computer could potentially be sucked up by that malware. So even if you kept your PGP key on a Yubiki, as soon as you decrypted the file on that compromised machine, it would load the contents in the memory. Is my next question? And any good malware would also be looking at what is currently in memory and siphoning that off? So even in that environment, the fact, it sounds to me like it doesn't matter even if he has the Yubiki, keeping that wallet file in the whole environment is just massive risk. Yeah, I mean, it creates an incredibly large attack surface and this kind of, you know, this is why it's really frustrating to see all of the foot, of course, you know, everybody attacking self custody. Who's saying a lot of people out there who have vested interests, I think against self custody saying, oh, look, even if this, you know, prominent protocol developer can't do it, then why should you believe you can. And I think that this is an interesting case of actually, you know, being so deep into Bitcoin and I think Luke would once again, I don't want to speak for him, but I think on various occasions he has said that, you know, he's not a security guy. I mean, he's a protocol and a software guy. And so he had this very unique setup with a lot of custom attributes and also I believe that he revealed a lot of that to the world, which in and of itself shouldn't be bad if your setup is secure. You should be able to reveal the architecture of your key management if it's secure. I mean, I could tell you my multi-sake security through obscurity is not a thing. But however, you know, he had so many custom attributes that it seems there were vulnerabilities. And this is a, this is one of those things where I think people should keep in mind the Bitcoin motto, you know, VIRIS in numerous, you know, strength and numbers. Now this applies to many different things in this space. Usually people are talking about, you know, the cryptographic security of public private keys and the fact that, you know, there's so many of them like that's why they're secure just through entropy. But it's also applicable to your security setup, your architecture for managing your keys. If you're using an architecture that you created yourself from scratch, then, and nobody else uses it and no one has ever vetted it, you know, it hasn't been stressed tested, it hasn't been adopted by other people, then it's highly likely that there are some holes and, you know, you have some blind spots like even myself, you know, I, I'm not omniscient, I can't see everything. Having good security is, it's kind of a community problem. It's the same thing with open source, right? Why does open source work? It's because you have many different sets of eyes, many different perspectives who are all looking at the same thing and attacking it from different ways. So if you decide to go out on your own in Bitcoin, you know, whatever you're doing, if no one else has done that, it's a lot riskier. Yeah. By the way, Debbie's just brought this up. They got my cold wallet too. That doesn't make sense. Yeah, I mean, I think that when he talks about his cold wallet, he's talking about these keys that he, he may have generated them offline 10 years ago, but I think it's pretty clear that they have been touching the internet at some point since then. Has he tweeted anything out? That's about it. No, not really. Send this, Samurai Guy has though. I don't actually fully understand what he's saying here. See, one of the interesting things is updating or modernizing your security protocols. Because when I first got in 2017, I bought a ledger straight away and I operated with a single hardware wallet and my actually no idea to add a ledger which had a majority of my crypto back there, not just Bitcoin. And I backed up my private key, but that was written and that was stored somewhere in the house. I didn't have a lot back then. We're talking like 25 grand. And then I had a Trezza, which was like my day to day and I memorized the pin. Okay. And then what happened is during that year, that became a meaningful amount of value. Sure. All on a single hardware wallet with a written like I knew I was eventually was in a scenario, but I didn't deal with that front. Yeah, if your house burned down, you'd have a problem. Yeah, we got. Yeah, we screwed. And so what happened is I eventually got to the point where I needed to sort this out. So I, the first thing was a metal device. I did that. That still could have been found in my house by somebody. So eventually got to multi-seag just because of Casa. But when I went back to the Trezza, I couldn't remember the pin. Oh, yeah. I hadn't written it down. I knew kind of what it was. And I was telling Danny the story earlier because I wanted to transfer it out into my Casa multi-seag. Every time I attempted it, the amount of time to have another go would go up. I went up an initial backup. Yeah. So it was, I can't remember what it seems like 30 seconds, then a minute, they're like three minutes and like eight minutes. Maybe it was, is that Pythagoras theory or whatever. Whatever. So it was about the fifth try I got it because I knew the four numbers ish. I think maybe five numbers and they're eventually figured it out. So I got there. But like that was a, that was a meaningful amount of Bitcoin, but not like a meaningful amount of my step, but I could have won a lose it. And so like over time, but I know at that point, I'd been very comfortable with Casa. But I probably need to test my keys. You know, and you should be getting reminders to the health checks. I do get my advice to the health checks. But to do a full health check, actually, this is another thing, right? I've discussed, I've made me even discuss with you the idea of publicly stating parts of my security. One of those things, what I'm happy to say is that to fully test my multi-sig, I have to get on a plane. And I'm like happy to say that. And so that's why I've got round to it because I have to be on a plane. So, so yeah, I mean, I can empathize a little bit with Luke in that like he's had something his work for 10 years. It works until it doesn't. Yeah, exactly. But you do need to keep updating. This is just like following the coin since then. And I think they've actually now like overnight gone into chip mixer, which I had never even heard of before. What's chip mixer? Just the mixing service. I don't know much about anything about it. So Luke, Luke, they put Luke Jr. Luke Dashard, stolen coins on the move, started a peel or something. Well, it just means that they're peeling off amounts in multiple transactions. The bulk of the continuing to P2PK H address and then a small amount peeled off to P2S H address remaining on spend the last two peel address types changed it. Like, okay, can they keep following this in a bit? Yeah, you know, these, you know, the OXT guys are pretty good at what they do. There's a number of folks who are pretty good at on chain analytics. Of course, eventually, over long enough period of time, the coins are sort of become part of the rest of the ecosystem. They get dispersed throughout many different wallets and services. And it just depends on what the attacker does with them and whether or not they make any mistakes or they could get caught and identified. Presumably that now it's in with chip mixer, it's over in terms of tracking it there. It's definitely a lot harder. Hmm. I hope he's okay. Luke's obviously been a very important person for Bitcoin. It's done some amazing things. That's why I didn't like the dunking on it. Oh, yeah, I mean, he's a controversial figure for a variety of reasons, but I don't think that that's good reason to wish harm upon him. Yeah, I hope he's okay. Well, yeah. We could just have to reiterate to people they have to take their security seriously. They have to keep updating their security, testing their security. So it's probably a good time to then talk about security planning. I obviously get a lot of emails in the show. Some people ask me about security. People bought maybe a ledger and say, what should I do? People get very, very nervous about using their ledger, say, for the first time. And I have the, it's almost like a copy and paste email now. It's set it up back up your private key, but I am a metal seed storage device. That's a $10 in, wipe it, restore it, check it still there, then send 10% send another 15% and then build up. That's really one of the most important parts that, you know, I'm actually, I'm kind of disappointed. As far as I'm aware, none of the hardware manufacturers out there say, hey, you should set this all up and then you should wipe it and then you should reload it. Like that wiping and reloading is one of the most important things. And one of the, the ways that I think a lot of people lose their coins is they just don't test the recovery. And then the first time they go to test it, they find out something is wrong. Yeah, they make a mistake right now in the recovery keywords. Yeah. Yeah, that's the same set of instructions. So I'm kind of looking to you more for your advice. Like if you're like, what are the logical steps you would say to somebody brand new to Bitcoin, you know, not technically competent. What would you say the first kind of steps all? Well, it, it depends on what value we're talking about, right? You know, if someone's dealing with 10 or $100, then I don't think they really need to put a lot of effort into thinking about security. You know, if it's a, a trivial amount that you would not really care about losing, the flip side is I think that whatever amount you do have, you should multiply it by 10 and that should be the amount that you are thinking about needs to be secured because of course is very volatile space and you can very easily like you said, go from having, you know, $1,000 to $10,000 or whatever, 10x the amount that you have and your security level is really only appropriate for one tenth of that. So, you know, I see it as, you know, if, if you're dealing with pocket money, then you're fine just using a software wallet on your mobile phone or your desktop or whatever because you're probably not going to lose any sleep if something catastrophic happens to that. If, you know, if you're dealing with a level that is, you know, thousands of dollars, if you're talking about, you know, a month's wages or more, a non-trivial amounts, then you should at least spend 50 or $100 and buy a dedicated hardware device for those private keys. And the hardware devices are, you know, the main players of its ledger, Trezza, cold card, and the main ones. Are there any new ones that, and do you support any other ones? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of newer ones and it's actually hard to even keep track of them all. And so, any ones that you as a company, right? Yeah, so, in addition, so from cold card, you know, based off of the cold card platform, there's the foundation passport, that and I believe it's a Cobo. We've started to add some of these devices that support the, it's called the UR 2.0 spec. It's basically it's animated QR codes for sending the data back and forth. And we really like those. And actually, I think Blockstream Jade just added support for this animated QR code spec. The reason that I like that is that it drastically simplifies the user experience, like you don't have these USB cables, you don't have to be plugging stuff in your literally, it's point and shoot to transfer the data back and forth for the signing operations. That's a cool look and device. Yeah. It's not cheap though. You know, I think, I think Trezor still has the most economical, but it doesn't have that animated QR code support. So it's a little less user friendly. If you tell me I use Trezor, it asks me to install a bridge. Yeah, basically drivers so that it can talk to your operating system. Yeah, I just trust it and install it. But I don't like going via browser. Yeah. I just don't like that. Is Trezor still a browser? Have they got software displays yet? Well, they have the Trezor suite. Okay. I think they rolled out last year. Okay. Have you seen the new Ledger stacks? I haven't got my hands on it. I think I said at the time, I was once again, I was disappointed that they haven't added a camera and because if they had a camera, they could then have the animated QR code support. So my understanding is it's still mostly going to be USB based. Maybe they'll have Bluetooth again like they did with the Nano X, but I'm not a fan of the Bluetooth stuff either because I think for most people, just the process you have to go through for pairing Bluetooth stuff is beyond a lot of people's capability. Yeah. They do look cool these though. They do look cool. Yeah. I mean, I've seen them in person. They are very cool. No, no, this is me being an aesthetic person. I have multiple wallets for day to day things and just having three or four of them. I mean, they're not cheap as well, but like having three or four like that is actually useful. But also, I travel with Bitcoin, not a lot. I travel with a small amount of Bitcoin just in case I have to do any transactions while we're away. This feels like an easier thing to carry around with me. It feels like something that goes like wallet phone that. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. So like, and then when you get into the world of like a meaningful amount of Bitcoin, you obviously going to recommend multi-zig. Well, yeah. So when you get to what I would call generational wealth, you know, an amount that is a significant portion of your life savings and that you're probably wanting to hold on to and pass on, you know, that's when you start to want to make sure that you don't have any single points of failure. You don't want one thing to go wrong that could then be catastrophic. So, you know, there's many different ways to eliminate single points of failure. Obviously, we're a big fan of multi-zig because I think that generally makes it easier. Now, you know, multi-zig is more complicated than a single signature wallet. You know, you're dealing with more pieces. You're dealing with more data. But also, if you do it right, you can end up with a much more robust setup. But once again, this kind of actually goes back to the discussion with Luke. You know, if you're rolling your own multi-zig setup, you need to be really, really careful about how you do it because there's many different ways that you can screw it up and and still introduce single points of failure. So if you're going to go with multi-zig, then I highly advise using what would be, like, considered a standard architecture. You know, two of three, three of five, not doing anything crazy with like scripts or derivation paths or whatever. But the big thing is, of course, make sure you can wipe it all and recreate it. And that's what we're definitely going for if we're talking about something that can go through an inheritance process. Like, it needs to be simple, not just for you, but for, you know, your non-technical family and heirs. I think I asked this last time I spoke to you. You've talked then about people rolling their own multi-zig, something I'm never going to do ever in my entire life. Have I done it? Have I? With their hodel and Phil Gaga. And I lost my key. Yeah. Exactly. I'm never going to do that, Jim. At the same time, I trust Casa to roll my multi-zig for me. In a scenario where you guys are doing big tech upgrades, how much sleep do you lose when you publish the new code? Actually, I sleep very well at night because I know that we don't have a threshold of keys that could be used against our customers. Like, even if Casa got completely compromised, then no one's going to lose their money. Right. You know, it's the very simple act of each of our clients having to verify their spending operations on hardware and software that Casa has no control over. That's what helps me sleep at night. Now that creates challenges for us because it means that we have all of these other vendors out there who are changing their software and we need to keep all of these pieces moving and in play and making sure that there aren't breaking changes, which happened. Like, we actually had one happen a few weeks ago. And thankfully, the vendor got it fixed very quickly. But that's part of what you're kind of paying for is for Casa to be handling all that like technical minutiae and make sure that everything is still operating as expected. Man, I could do it. I was still asleep. You mentioned inheritance planning there. So on a personal level, less than one thing, I haven't solved in probably the best way possible. Now, look, I know Casa has a plan for that, but just say you can't afford that Casa solution. Maybe it's a bit too high for you, but you do want to make a plan. You have personal recommendations for planning because like I have some, it puts trust in certain things, which I don't want to explain here. And I've tried to put a scenario that doesn't put me in a scenario where anything could be stolen, but like in a scenario where something happens, things can be brought together. What and maybe when you explain it, it's similar to what I'm doing, but it's like certain recommendations are definitely planning. Because I mean, didn't that do that like old crazy Romanian Bitcoin guy drowned? Yeah, a marker. Yeah, he didn't have inheritance planning set up. That we know of. That we know of. Yeah, did he really drown? Did he really have Bitcoin? Was he really Romanian? By the way, he was crazy. He was one of the most eccentric figures in the space for sure. Who did he death through? He'd willed. Andreas. Death through it, Peter Willai as well. Yes. And I think that was for segwit. Interesting. Complicitful another day. Okay. So what kind of advice recommendations would you have for people? Yes. So inheritance planning for these bare assets is a really interesting tight rope to walk. Because presumably if you're self-custed. Of course, if you keep all your money with a third party, then you can just give them inheritance instructions and assume that they'll follow that. But if you're self-custed, then presumably you want to retain control of your assets as long as you're alive. But then you somehow want this switch to flip when you pass that transitions control to some predetermined entity or set of people or whatever. And of course, this is not something that you can do within the Bitcoin protocol or really any protocol. It's the oracle problem, right? The none of these protocols or blockchains have any understanding of quote unquote real-world events. So you have to get other humans involved, humans who are going to be doing things like authenticating your dest certificate or whatever proof of death there is. And there's a million different ways to do it and you roll your own setup essentially. And some of them may be more trusted than others. I mean, the very naive thing to do would to be have a trusted friend, family or attorney or someone who has a fiduciary duty to you. You just give them the keys to the kingdom and pray that they will be honorable and not access anything. The more common thing that we see happen is people create what I would call treasure hunts. You distribute keys or you distribute different pieces of keys or passwords or whatever all around across different locations, different people. And presumably they will come together and help reconstitute that. And I should know because that's the type of setup that I had back in the day. And I have a lengthy blog post where I went into describing how I did that, but it was very technical and never actually done. Well, I never even actually tested it from the sense of like making my executors try to follow my instructions. So I kind of broke one of the cardinal rules there that it was not well tested and it very well may not have worked or it may have been too technical for some of them to understand because they had to run this like special Shmir's secret sharing software and they had to get the pieces of the decryption keys from different places. But we at CASA, we have a couple different ways that you can do the inheritance. But essentially you're distributing keys so that you retain access and control and custody while you're alive. And then CASA can facilitate essentially verifying proof of death and signing with the CASA key. And then you may involve your attorney or another trusted entity who would have one key. And be able to do the same. So you have a key, they have a key, where's the third key you've come from? So there's also a CASA mobile key basically your account key is on your phone. So you give someone access to the phone? Yes. Yeah. Interesting. I mean, mine's kind of a treasure hunt. I can't explain what it is. I'll tell you what, tell your friend. But mine's kind of a treasure hunt. I probably should just get the CASA one. I'll do that to give them to me. Cool. Brilliant. Okay. Anything else on security, if we'd not touch, because I do want to get into tech with you. I think that's enough for an hour. I mean, security is another rabbit hole and it's a never-ending battle. So there's always stuff to talk about, but it can get a bit repetitive. So you said it's been a good year in tech. What's the thing you've enjoyed most in tech? Definitely AI. Okay. I've spent the most time playing around with. And AI seems to have gone through a bit of a renaissance in 2022. Part of that, of course, is the software, but also there have been hardware advancements that have gotten us like orders of magnitude improvement. So you know, I was playing around with the image generation stuff. Obviously, the chat GPT and other language text-based stuff. I actually published an article in Bitcoin magazine that I don't think I've even told anyone this yet, but the majority of it was actually written with AI. It was this dystopian future CBDC piece. Oh my God. Yeah. That's an exclusive. What Bitcoin did exclusive? You got Digdab on it. Yeah. I'm going to look. Is that the San Francisco? Yes. San Francisco in 2033 or something like that. Okay. Let me, let me, let me, let's just read the first couple of paragraphs. This is a science fiction piece by James. I'm like, okay, good morning. I'm gently awoken by my smartwatch is soothing female voice. It's a bit robotic, but does have a touch of personality and charm. Today's month, it's my birthday. Today is Monday October 31st, 2033. It continues. Your weekly basic income is 3,000 for what the fuck? And has your weekly basic income of 3,432 dollars has been deposited in your account? 1,049 was held with hell to pay your student loan. 2,300 dollars with hell for your land on like stone hathaway. Shit. That's a bit more than last week. There must have been another inflation adjustment. So, so what did you do? Did you do it bit by bit? Yeah. I forget which service I even used. It was a prompt generation tool where I could write a basic outline of the story. And it would just start filling in pieces. And then I could sort of roll the dice and get different paragraphs and then choose a paragraph and then say, okay, now take this and ingest it and do the next paragraph. And or I could even say now delve deeper into this character's backstory and so on. Yeah. I mean, look, I love Chaggy BT. I think it's amazing. Danny, Danny, we're using it now. Tell Jamiesl. Well, we kind of used it as a joke first because it came up in the interview with Danny Scott and we said, so when I first played with it, I typed in some prompts to get a podcast description and it was pretty good, but we didn't use it. And so then after the Danny Scott show, we did actually use it in his description. And I don't think they're good enough all the time. Yeah, well, I don't think they're good enough all the time, but they give you a really good structure at least to work from. And it's a bit like with Royal Bedford, I do the match reports, but actually what happens is the commentator writes a match report and then I go through it and like update it, just get in the style we want. But it saves me hours because he's done the majority of the work. Yeah. And that's really what I think AI is going to be doing. It's not going to be completely displacing jobs. It's going to be another tool that gives people an order of magnitude performance improvement with what they're doing. So this was 100% written by AI. Okay. In this episode of this podcast, I sit down with Danny Scott, the CEO of CoinGorna, a Bitcoin exchange based in the UK. Danny has built CoinGorna into a successful business without relying on VC funding. And he shares his insights on the challenges and opportunities of doing so in a highly competitive world of Bitcoin during our conversation. We discussed the current state of Bitcoin adoption and the importance of making cryptocurrency accessible and user friendly for those who are new to the space. Danny shares his thoughts on the role of the lightning network and driving adoption. And how it is. It's pretty, I don't know if it's actually read this. It's pretty good. Yeah. And there's like, as I read it, there's a couple of bits I'll change. Like making cryptocurrency accessible. Yeah. It would be of either making the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin accessible overall. It's a fascinating conversation with the true industry leader tuning into his insights and building a Bitcoin business, driving adoption in the future of Bitcoin industry. Do you know what I do like about it? But maybe I don't like about it. It feels more polished. It feels of something like maybe the BBC would do. Well, maybe they're using AI. But there's a bit that are a bit cringe, but like you could use that and then build out off it very easily. Well, if I was writing a description, I reckon someone had that. I'd spend 15, 20 minutes, but would check GBT in two minutes. Yeah. You just read through an editor. Yeah. I much prefer to edit something than have to write the whole thing from scratch. And you are testing it for something else? Well, just after the show with David Zell, someone got a touch and said we could put input the audio from the podcast and use it to generate show notes, which would be definitely saved time. Yeah. And I've been doing that myself. I just wrapped up a month long archival project where my problem is pretty much every interview I've ever done is hosted by other people. And over the past 10 years, Linkerot sets in. People take their sights offline. We lose content. And so I got tired of that happening. And so I wrote some scripts to basically suck down every video and MP3 that I've ever been in over the past 10 years. And once I had them all, this is 45 gigabytes of files. I then wrote some other scripts to extract the audio and then yet another script and doing this all in bulk, of course, to take those audio files and transcribe them with an open AI whisper. Okay, but is the finding bit, is that AI or is that just Google search? Well the finding bit was easy as a result of my OCD because I already have all of them linked on my website. So I wrote a script to basically parse through all the URLs on my website. Can you bring up a chat GPT? Yeah. Just wanted to try something here. Try this one. Tell the story of Jamison Blop, because this is what it's good. And Peter McCall-Maxx. Today are fun shooting guns. I've done so many of these just like stupid little things. Oh, so it's looking for a story. See that's weird because we used to have it right in stories. Maybe if we say tell me a fictional story. Yeah, so that's weird because it used to do that. I was getting it to write stories. This actually goes back to censorship. Where they've really been clamping down on what the AI can do, all of these different AI services because people are abusing them. Yeah, but hold on. Then what's the point in having it? Are they worried about like university kids having their course what written on that? There's so many different things that people are worried about. Whether it's just like low level bias, biases that are inherent in this stuff. Because all of this stuff is being trained off of data and all of the data is being generated by humans and humans have biases. So it's going to be representative of some subset of humanity. I mean, it's like the internet will pick coin can be used for good or bad, right? We know that with Bitcoin. I always go back to Peter Van Valkenberg's. So that's something that you already said for every person you talk about using Bitcoin for money laundering. I'm going to tell you about, I'm going to use in Bitcoin in Nigeria to campaign against police violence. I always think that's a great way of telling the story of technology. AI, we can use this to write descriptions and save us time to do show notes. I'm going to come back to that as well, by the way. But also, kids are going to be able to use it to not have to do coursework. The cats out of the bag. Well, this is kind of like security. This is going to be a never ending battle. So I've already seen stories of professors and teachers saying that they're suspecting certain students of using these AI text generators to do their essays for them. And then just in the past week or so, we saw one university student create a quote-unquote AI detector. I'm glad about this. But this is going to go back and forth. Then the AI is going to be modified or people are going to basically be hacking, quote-unquote hacking. With this, it's really, it's more about trying different prompts to work their way around the filters. That's what I would say these AI hackers have been doing is we're understanding that the people who are running the servers for this stuff, they're filtering things, especially on the image generators, because of course there's a lot of crazy stuff you could do there. But there's always ways to work your way around it. These are essentially this prompt generation as a new sphere of kind of programming language. It's just not a very well-defined programming language. And so people are trying to really push the limits of what's possible with it. And as they do that, the folks that are running these services are then saying, oh, we need to stop that. And so it's just the same old, same old issue of censorship. So interesting, Danny's just doing the test on an AI content detector. And this is the description from that Danny's got show that was 100% AI. And he thinks it's 2% human generated. Pretty good. Yeah. Interesting. Go and get one of our other descriptions. All right. And to see what happens with that, go and get to the show notes, Danny. What I don't know is if you can read the content, how does it know what is something we would want as a show note? Again, I think it probably gives you a massive list and you would then have to just cut it. Yeah. And then you're saying with the timestamps, how does it know what a section is? I don't know if it could do timestamp. No, it can. The email I forwarded you this morning, right? That was, he said he can do timestamps. If he gets to the point where it can do show notes timestamps and transcriptions, it puts people out of work for us. I mean, here you go. I've just put another description in that was human generated and it's got it 100%. That's fascinating. That is fascinating. So I wonder how it's doing that, whatever, the cat is out of the bag with this. People use it for good and people use it for bad. I think in this scenario, there's a lot of good that you can use it for efficiencies. The downside of that is people potentially losing jobs. You could identify that in our world. I struggle to see too much evil it can be used for on text generation yet. But it feels like we're now in this very early stage of this AI thing that might move quickly. Yeah, I mean, the robots are coming. Well, I think the very first thing I would look at is, you know, what do a lot of scammers do and why couldn't you have an AI bot that basically follows the rules for some particular scam that people perpetrate over the internet? Yeah. That's very true. Can you ask them to write code? Yeah. I saw somebody said they put some coding. I can't remember what the language was and they wanted to convert it to Python and it converted it to Python and executed and worked instantly. Well, I can't remember what, can you think of a language you would convert from something to Python? You said say two days of work. Huh? Same two days of work. That's generally saying it saves it. So you've seen that tweet. Yeah. So do you remember what code it was? Like from what? It was a function. I don't remember what kind of function I don't know if it's a JavaScript. So two days of work was saved, convert from one programmer language to another. Again, fascinating and great puts people out of work potentially, but drives efficiencies. Well, I mean, if you think about it as a programmer, I've always found it to be incredibly inefficient, basically with the interface of how I talk to the machine and how I instruct the machine, of what I want it to do. This is why programming you pay so well and why it's so difficult. It's because the machine does exactly what we tell it to and the vast majority of time, what we're telling it is not actually what we want. And that's because of the limitations of programming languages and just the complexity of software. So my ideal future is a Star Trek future. Computer creates a simulation that does this thing and then a few hours go by and it gives you the result or whatever. And even past that, right now we have text-based AI. We're prompting it now, instead of having to learn the syntax and semantics of some foreign computer programming language, you're able to use English and probably other languages. I'm not familiar with what they've done with regard to other foreign languages, but there's no reason why you couldn't use any human language. And even that, that's a huge leap forward, but that is only the beginning. I actually wrote an article about Elon Musk and Twitter and stuff earlier last year, where I said what I'm really looking forward to is direct neural interface with the machines. Now of course there's pros and cons, but if you think about it from an efficiency standpoint, of course there's huge security or ramifications, but from an efficiency standpoint, even what we're doing right now, me having to think something, then having to translate it into English and then it has to get transferred through the air and interpreted by your ears and turned into signals in your brain, that is incredibly inefficient when there's no reason why we couldn't have a direct neural electrical signal to neural electrical signal. Yeah, but do you want that? Well, yes, I'm sure this will create more dystopian outcomes as well. So Danny's found the tweet, I just gave chat GBT 200 lines of JavaScript code and asked it to translate the code into Python. The code passes text using regular expressions. It was complex. Two minutes later, I had Python code that worked flawlessly. The thing just saved me a couple of days of work. That's fucking insane. Yeah. But my, well, so firstly, I think Twitter is going to get damaged by this. I think they're nefarious actors and as well as just some morons who are going to spin up accounts with chat GBT and start arguing. Oh, I've seen them already. And I've actually, I've run the Turing test questions against some of them. It's been obvious that they're not human. But like, it's just going to get to a stage where talking to people you don't know is going to be pointless. Like, I almost going to get to a point in my Twitter and just like, I only want to see people like, no, that's going to become pointless. But I'm also like looking forward to all this kind of not looking forward is excited, but just looking forward considering like the singularity of all these technologies coming together. Quantum AI, neural link. I think it's a bit shit. I think I don't want to go and live in a cabin and these like speak to humans and have no technology. I can see a scenario where people start to reject technology and want to live without it. I can see a scenario where I get a bit older and I'm like, do you know what? And I want a phone, maybe an old dial up for a hand phone and go and live in a cabin somewhere with a dog Danny Pop's own occasionally. Yeah, I mean, especially if you're being bombarded with noise all day long. And you know, I'm an optimist. So I think that there will be solutions to all of this. And one solution, for example, to the issue of noise and reputation on social networks is actually something I've talked about a few times, a hive. They're essentially mapping social networks. They're starting with Twitter, but they've mapped something like 400 different quote unquote communities or you call them interest groups or specialties on Twitter. And you know, they're just using the sort of connection graphs to show, you know, where are people focusing their attention? And it's a very hard thing to fake. You can spin up a million bonds, but you can't convince a million people to follow them. I know you're a really good ball. Yeah, unless you're actually creating real valuable content, in which case, you know, maybe it's a signal, but you know, not annoying as, but what's that film where the guy falls in love with a AI bot? Is it him? Her, she? Her, her. Her? Yeah. Have you seen that film? Yep. I mean, a brilliant film. She was pretty convincing. He fell in love. Yeah, I'm sure that will happen. Yeah. So when they combine it with a real doll, have you ever seen that film on the lines on the real doll? Yeah. It's a good film. Yeah, I don't know, man. It's just like we're going a bit too far. Well, this is the thing, right? Is that this is why it's great to be a technologist because technology is not just going forward linearly. It's accelerating. Because humans generally don't like change. Or at least we like to say that we don't like change. We're very adaptive humans. So in hindsight, you know, you look back over the past few years or decades or whatever. And you know, change has been crazy. And yet we somehow keep adapting to it. And so we will keep adapting, it will keep creating more and more weirdness. You know, if someone from today is looking 10 years in the future, I can guarantee you their mind will be blown. But the people who are living in the present day in the future will be like, yep, this is how things are now. What about combining AI with CRISPR? And just saying like, yeah, like some fucking crazy kid in his dorm. Yeah, create me something that is, yeah. Dangerous as a boat up at spreads like COVID. Map it out. Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of ramifications when it comes to biotechnology. I'm especially afraid of nanotechnology. There's this one dystopian apocalypse. It's called the gray goose scenario. But essentially that's a scenario where nanobots go out of control replicating. There's no way for us to stop them and they turn the entire earth into nanobots and there's no way to escape them. Oh, man, see, I guess we're going to live in the cabin. I don't know. It's too far. I kind of feel like we've got to live through this like golden age of technology. And then we might also, because of the exponential nature technology, live through the start of the dystopian era. Yeah, you're an optimist. Well, I mean, but there's also the great filter question, which this is, this is more of an astrophysics question of like, why don't we hear signals from other species? And these paradox. Yeah. Yeah. And so the simple explanation is that every species that becomes sentient and develops technology that is sufficient to start creating signals that propagate through the universe, eventually also hits this inflection point, which we may be close to, wherein the power of the technology becomes uncontrollable and they destroy themselves for one of a million different reasons. Yeah, Jesus Christ, man. All right. What about nostra? Yes. That's an interesting new protocol. What is it? I think it's notes and other stuff transmitted by relays is what actually is. The acronym stands for. And a lot of people are looking at it and saying, oh, it's the new Twitter, but it's not a social network. It's literally just a protocol for passing messages around a peer to peer network. And these messages are cryptographically signed and they have some interesting attributes. But there's a lot of pros of what you can build on top of a network like that. There's also a lot of challenges that are going to have to be overcome if nostra is going to become a globally adopted network. So it is a protocol, but you can build a Twitter on top of it. Yes. Yeah. So whatever it's mean challenges, because I mean, most people who listen to this with a lot of people signed up and checked it out. Yeah. I mean, there's some scaling challenges. There's some security challenges. One of the problems right now is that you have a single public private key pair and you're reusing that for everything. So if that ever gets compromised, you're screwed. There's no way to revoke that and change to another key. I think that's going to be addressed, of course. You would want, perhaps some sort of hierarchical deterministic wallet where you can migrate what key you're using. There's also ways to do that with decentralized identifiers of which there are a number of different projects out there, which would allow you to have your identity that is then separate from the actual keys that you're using for this. And also right now, most people who are using nostra clients are literally pasting their private key into an internet connected device. There's a few ways around that as well. And hopefully, you'll eventually just have your dedicated hardware device that you'll use for that. From the scaling standpoint, it's kind of like Bitcoin in the sense that it's kind of like a flood fill network. All of the relays are essentially listening to each other. You can filter things out, but in general right now, if you broadcast a message and it's correctly signed, it's generally going to go to all of the other relays out there. So there's a question of how much can that scale before we start to see some limitations, whether it's bandwidth limitations, disk storage limitations, what are the incentives? What is the game theory of the network? Is it denial of service protected? So like when you run a Bitcoin node, Bitcoin node software has a ton of different denial of service checks that it's running whenever it's receiving new data. And if you do something to violate any of those, it considers you a bad peer and it basically cuts you off and it stops talking to you. I don't know the nostra relays well enough to say if they have a denial of service checks built in, if they don't, then there's going to be some growing pains and I expect more tools and rules are going to be built around that. And then there's also just the incentive question of who's running the nodes? Why or how are you going to let other random third parties connect to your node? Are you going to require some sort of small fee? I know there is an improvement proposal that would allow you to actually attach some proof of work to your nostra messages. I don't know how widely that's been implemented. But that's just a high level gist of there are open issues that are going to need to be resolved. But I expect that the network is going to continue to grow. It's going to have growing pains. And as long as there is sufficient interest in development around it, then people are going to find solutions to these issues. Okay. We need to play a little bit more with so we'll check that out. Is there anything else that I'd see? Good question. I mean, most of the stuff that I've been doing has been around AI and combining different aspects of AI. So I think people see these tools and they don't really extrapolate what the tool is going to be able to do in several years. So like we see people creating images. And right now all they're thinking about is, oh, I can type in a prompt and I can get a cool two dimensional image or whatever. But obviously that's only the beginning. The next steps we're going to see, you know, three dimensional models. I think this is already starting to happen. We should expect that architects and designers, game designers and whatever are going to be able to use AI to start generating entire virtual worlds. I've already seen AI image generation added as a plug-in to 3D modeling tools so that you can say, you know, I've created this landscape or this cityscape or whatever. And I don't want to have to spend days like finding and applying textures. I'm just going to type in a prompt and I say, you know, make this building look like, you know, Gothic architecture from the 1500s or whatever. So, you know, this is why I say I sure AI may get rid of some jobs. But in general, it's just going to accelerate our productivity and be a new set of tools that much like how computing and the internet in general has affected every industry. I think AI is going to have a similar reach. Yeah, well, until we place ourselves with robots, who are more efficient, there will be that transition stage which is new rolling. And then it will just replace the bits of it. We won't need the body because the body is fucking useless. We can probably make a better body. And then we'll all be gone. Yeah. But then, I mean, kind of getting back to Bitcoin and stuff, you know, lightning network has definitely been interesting to see all of the new developments that have been going on there. I think in my annual report that I put out recently, you know, I showed that the actual like capacity of lightning network, it's gone up in Bitcoin terms over the past year. I think it's gone down a little in dollar terms, of course, due to the exchange rate. But up in Bitcoin terms, it's a bit of measure. If you're using it as your unit of count, yeah. But, but, and generally, we're seeing more and more businesses that are building on top of it. And, you know, who knows what's going to happen once we have other assets and other tokens on lightning. But I also think that, you know, this is going to, you know, supercharge a number of other networks and services in the ecosystem, kind of getting getting back to, you know, in Oster again, I had a tweet where I said, you know, it's actually quite appropriate that Oster was invented by a lightning developer because I think that, you know, that's going to be a very important integration in order to get the incentives right for a network like this. And, you know, if we can get to a point where we really have these decentralized peer-to-peer networks where the incentives are such that you can access them and use them by actually paying for what you're using and doing all of this without AML, KYC, and privacy ramifications. You know, this is getting us towards more of the anarcho-capitalistic cyberpunk future that I've been trying to build for a decade. Yeah. I mean, it's very exciting. The AI is very exciting, but, you know, I think it's really cool that lightning's growing. I think the different use cases people have discovered for a lightning. I love this idea of moving the fear of money around the world on the lightning network and bypassing banks. I think that's a super cool idea. So like, I think there's lots of cool things happening. I can't believe after five years we're actually sat here doing this again. That is also, I wonder if we'll be here in five more years doing this. If we are, then, you know, it's once again, it's going to be another order of magnitude of weirdness that has transpired since then. Yeah, we might record it in the metaverse. And Danny might have been replaced by AI. We might have generated all the surroundings using AI. We can generate this to look just like this. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be pretty cool. Yeah, I mean, I was really interested in VR, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. There was a number of VR related meetups and stuff that seems to have plateaued over the past couple of years. But I'm hopeful that something like neural link will actually be like the next step. It's still, it's very clunky to actually put on a headset and there's a number of things you have to configure. If you want a good VR setup where it's driven by a PC, the standalone one that's just don't have enough processing power to do the same level of, you know, of videographics and whatnot. But, well, this competition coming into that market because Apple has just announced this kind of kind of leaked. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, look, I've got the original first Oculus Rift. When I've used it for what I've used it for, I've loved it. Not for gaming. The gaming is just not decent games. But the more exercise side of gaming I have like, so there's like a thing where you use like these disc flight, you know, the punch and more duck under them. Like it's a good workout. There's the boxing game, which is an unbelievable workout where you feel like you're in the ring. You need that feedback. So like if you hit the like, it feels like you'd be in here. Yeah. Or it puts your head back. But as a workout, it's fucking insane and it's fun. That's the only stuff I've really liked on it. And also like, and get people to walk the plank and then push them over. But that's it. But I'm interested in it. It just feels like there was enough money in it for the developers to make the game. Like the boxing game, like like, is made by one dude on his own. Yep. You know, it's not like you're at Square Enix. Is it Square Enix at the company? Yeah, it's not like they've got like hundreds of people working on single games yet. So like, I think maybe if we get to that point, I think it'll be interesting. If you go, if you go for your, no, never done it. Never, never tried it. Thanks so many. You can't show you that. Have you done the, what the plank? Oh, yeah. The funny thing is I did the walk to plank in 2002. What? Yeah. I know, right? This is actually not a new thing. We just walking on a plank. So it was when I was hunting for universities to go to when I was in high school, I went to the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and they had one of the preeminent graphics departments and they had a room about the size of the house that we're in right now. That was their VR lab. And you know, this is multi-million dollar equipment back then, but they let me go through a simulation, which it was a plank simulation. Over, you know, it wasn't over. Like the one that you did was probably at the top of a building. The one that they did was literally just over like a pit. You know, it was much more simple, but it was the same type of a fact where you would feel like you would fall off. Do you know this walk the plank? Yeah, I've heard you talk. Yeah. I'm telling you, like, I'm not somebody who loves heights. Like you feel it. You believe you're up there. But I can do it. I can like look under my goggles, I can see my floor and then I can look up and there's no way I'm dropping off the end of that plank. Like that. I just can't do it. I think I like the idea of VR. I like, I kind of like the idea of VR in a world where we can make the podcast. We do this in person because you cannot replicate this conversation we're having over zoom. It just doesn't work. It's a different conversation. You have the latency is different. You have a different emotional connection. Everything about it's different. I think that gap can be closed with VR. Believe it can be. So that's maybe. I tell you what, if it's ever available, we'll do that one first. You and I. Absolutely. James, I could see you. Thank you for coming in. I appreciate everything you do. I appreciate you from episode three of What They're Conded. What do you want to send people to? Well, the easiest way to find me is at lop.net. L-O-P-P dot net. And from there, you can find all my resources and Twitter account and so on and so forth. But I think the short version take away a lot of this stuff. You seem to focus a lot on the dystopian aspects. I'm the techno optimist. I think that humanity is going to continue to keep stumbling forward. And there's not really too much use worrying about the million different apocalyptic scenarios that may or may not happen. I will try and be more of an optimist. Thank you for everything you've done, not just for me, but in Bitcoin and just being a general badass. Thank you so much, man.
